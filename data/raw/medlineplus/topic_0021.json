This is more common in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseasechronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD). Chronic bronchitis is a long-term condition.

      "content": "Treatment Most people DO NOT need antibiotics for acute bronchitis caused by a virus. The infection will almost always go away on its own within 1 week, though a mild cough may persist for up to 3 weeks. Doing these things may help you feel better: Drink plenty of fluids. If you have asthma or another chronic lung condition, use your inhaler . Get plenty of rest. Take aspirin or acetaminophen if you have a fever. DO NOT give aspirin to people under age 18. Breathe moist air by using a humidifier or steaming up the bathroom. Certain medicines that you can buy without a prescription can help break up or loosen mucus. Look for the word \"guaifenesin\" on the label. If needed, ask the pharmacist for help finding it. If your symptoms do not improve or if you are wheezing , your provider may prescribe an inhaler to open your airways. If your provider thinks you also have bacteria in your airways, they may prescribe antibiotics. This medicine will only get rid of bacteria, not viruses. Your provider may also prescribe corticosteroid medicine to reduce swelling in your lungs. If you have influenza and it is caught in the first 48 hours after getting sick, your provider might also prescribe antiviral medicine. Other tips include: DO NOT smoke. Avoid secondhand smoke and air pollution. Wash your hands (and your children's hands) often to avoid spreading viruses and other germs."

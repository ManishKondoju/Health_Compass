      "content": "Symptoms Hepatitis may start and get better quickly. It may also become a long-term condition. In some cases, hepatitis may lead to liver damage, liver failure, cirrhosis, liver cancer or even death. There are several factors that can affect how severe the condition is. These may include the cause of the liver damage and any illnesses you have. Hepatitis A, for example, is most often short-term and does not lead to chronic liver problems. The symptoms of hepatitis include: Pain or bloating in the belly area Dark urine and pale or clay-colored stools Fatigue Low grade fever Itching Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Weight loss You may not have symptoms when first infected with hepatitis B or C. You can still develop liver failure later. If you have any risk factors for either type of hepatitis, ask your health care provider whether you should be tested for them."

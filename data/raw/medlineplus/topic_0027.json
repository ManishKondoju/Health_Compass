  "summary": "Normal body temperature may change during any given day. It is usually highest in the evening. Other factors that may affect body temperature are: Fever is an important part of the body's defense against infection. Most bacteria and viruses that cause infections in people thrive best at 98.6°F (37°C). Many infants and children develop high fevers with mild viral illnesses. Although a fever signals that a battle might be going on in the body, the fever is fighting for, not against the person. Brain damage from a fever generally will not occur unless the fever is over 107.6°F (42°C). Untreated fevers caused by infection will seldom go over 105°F (40.6°C) unless the child is overdressed or in a hot place.",

Other factors that may affect body temperature are: A woman's menstrual cycle. In the second part of this cycle, her temperature may go up by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more. Physical activity, strong emotion, eating, heavy clothing, medicines, high room temperature, and high humidity can all increase body temperature. Fever is an important part of the body's defense against infection. Most bacteria and viruses that cause infections in people thrive best at 98.6°F (37°C).

Untreated fevers caused by infection will seldom go over 105°F (40.6°C) unless the child is overdressed or in a hot place. Febrile seizures do occur in some children. Most febrile seizures are over quickly and do not mean your child has epilepsy. These seizures also do not cause any permanent harm. Unexplained fevers that continue for days or weeks are called fevers of undetermined origin (FUO)."

      "content": "Causes Almost any infection can cause a fever, including: Bone infections ( osteomyelitis ), appendicitis , skin infections or cellulitis , and meningitis Respiratory infections such as colds or flu -like illnesses, sore throats (pharyngitis), ear infections ( otitis ), sinus infections ( sinusitis ), mononucleosis , bronchitis , pneumonia , and tuberculosis Urinary tract infections Viral gastroenteritis and bacterial gastroenteritis Children and adults may have a low-grade fever for 1 or 2 days after some immunizations . Teething may cause a slight increase in a child's temperature, but not higher than 100°F (37.8°C). Autoimmune or inflammatory disorders may also cause fevers. Some examples are: Arthritis or connective tissue illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease Vasculitis or periarteritis nodosa The first symptom of a cancer may be a fever. This is particularly true of Hodgkin disease , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , and leukemia . Other possible causes of fever include: Blood clots or thrombophlebitis Medicines, such as some antibiotics, antihistamines, and seizure medicines"

      "content": "Home Care A simple cold or other viral infection can sometimes cause a high fever (102°F to 104°F or 38.9°C to 40°C). This does not mean you or your child has a serious problem. Some serious infections don't cause a fever or can cause a very low body temperature, most often in infants. If the fever is mild and you have no other problems, you do not need treatment. Drink fluids and rest. The illness is probably not serious if your child: Is still interested in playing Is eating and drinking well Is alert and smiling at you Has a normal skin color Looks well when their temperature comes down Take steps to lower a fever if you or your child is uncomfortable, vomiting, dried out (dehydrated), or not sleeping well. Remember, the goal is to lower, not eliminate, the fever. When trying to lower a fever: Do not bundle up someone who has chills. Remove excess clothing or blankets. The room should be comfortable, not too hot or cool. Try one layer of lightweight clothing, and one lightweight blanket for sleep. If the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help. A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool someone with a fever. This is effective after medicine is given -- otherwise the temperature might bounce right back up. Do not use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs. These cool the skin, but often make the situation worse by causing shivering, which raises the core body temperature. Here are some guidelines for taking medicine to lower a fever: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce fever in children and adults. Sometimes health care providers advise you to use both types of medicine. Take acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours. It works by turning down the brain's thermostat. Take ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours. Do not use ibuprofen in children 6 months or younger. Aspirin is very effective for treating fever in adults. Do not give aspirin to a child unless your child's provider tells you to. Know how much you or your child weighs. Then check the instructions on the package to find the correct dose. In children 3 months or younger, contact your child's provider first before giving medicines. Eating and drinking: Everyone, particularly children, should drink plenty of fluids. Water, ice pops, soup, and gelatin are all good choices. In younger children do not give too much fruit juice or apple juice, and do not give sports drinks. Although eating is fine, do not force foods."

  "summary": "Most UTIs are caused by bacteria that enter the urethra and then the bladder. The infection most commonly develops in the bladder, but can spread to the kidneys. Most of the time, your body can get rid of these bacteria. However, certain conditions increase the risk for having UTIs. Women tend to get them more often because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus than in men. Because of this, women are more likely to get an infection after sexual activity or when using a diaphragm for birth control. Menopause also increases the risk for a UTI. The following also increase your chances of developing a UTI:",

This test can diagnose an infection most of the time. Clean-catch urine culture -- This test may be done to identify the bacteria and determine the best antibiotic for treatment. Blood tests such as complete blood count ( CBC ) and a blood culture may be done as well. You may also need the following tests to help check for other problems in your urinary system: CT scan of the abdomen Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) Kidney ultrasound Voiding cystourethrogram"

      "content": "Treatment Your health care provider must first decide if the infection is just in the bladder, or if it has spread to the kidneys and how severe it is. MILD BLADDER AND KIDNEY INFECTIONS Most of the time, you will need to take an antibiotic to prevent the infection from spreading to the kidneys. For a simple bladder infection, you will take antibiotics for 1 to 5 days (women) or 7 to 14 days (men). The length of treatment depends on the antibiotic used. If you are pregnant or have diabetes, or have a mild kidney infection, you will most often take antibiotics for 7 to 14 days. Finish all of the antibiotics, even if you feel better. If you do not finish the whole dose of medicine, the infection may return and be harder to treat later. Always drink plenty of water when you have a bladder or kidney infection. Tell your provider if you might be pregnant before taking these medicines. RECURRENT BLADDER INFECTIONS Some women have repeated bladder infections. Your provider may suggest that you: Take a single dose of an antibiotic after sexual contact to prevent an infection. Have a 3 to 5 day course of antibiotics at home to use if you develop an infection. Take a single, daily dose of an antibiotic to prevent infections. MORE SEVERE KIDNEY INFECTIONS You may need to go into the hospital if you are very sick and cannot take medicines by mouth or drink enough fluids. You may also be admitted to the hospital if you: Are an older adult Have kidney stones or changes in the anatomy of your urinary tract Have recently had urinary tract surgery Have cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis , spinal cord injury, or other medical problems Are pregnant and have a fever or are otherwise ill At the hospital, you will receive fluids and antibiotics through a vein. Some people have UTIs that do not go away with treatment or keep coming back. These are called chronic UTIs. If you have a chronic UTI, you may need stronger antibiotics or to take medicine for a longer time. You may need surgery if the infection is caused by a problem with the structure of the urinary tract."

Research indicates that adults should get 7 to 9 hours sleep per night. Treatment often begins by reviewing any medicines or health problems that may be causing or worsen insomnia, such as: Enlarged prostate gland or any other medical condition, causing men to wake up at night to urinate Pain or discomfort from muscle, joint, or nerve disorders, such as arthritis and Parkinson disease Other medical conditions, such as acid reflux, allergies, and thyroid problems Mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety You should also think about lifestyle and sleep habits that may affect your sleep. This is called sleep hygiene. Making some changes in your sleep habits may improve or solve your insomnia. Some people may need medicines to help with sleep for a short period of time. But in the long run, making changes in your lifestyle and sleep habits is the best treatment for problems with falling and staying asleep. Most over-the-counter (OTC) sleeping pills contain antihistamines. These medicines are commonly used to treat allergies. Your body quickly becomes used to them. Sleep medicines called hypnotics can be prescribed by your provider to help reduce the time it takes you to fall asleep. Most of these can become habit-forming. Medicines used to treat anxiety or depression can also help with sleep Different methods of talk therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), may help you gain control over anxiety or depression."

These technologies can be particularly useful during a public health emergency. Geofencing technologies are location-based services in which an application (app) or other software program uses a mobile device’s global positioning system (GPS) to prompt a specific message, push notification or mobile advertisement (e.g., on web browsers or apps) when that device enters or exits a defined “geofence” or shortly thereafter. Ageofenceis a virtual perimeter around a real-world geographic area, which could include an airport or land border, school, shopping mall, stadium, or other geographic area."

A geofence does not track your location or your phone number; it is solely used to detect devices that may enter a specific geographic area at a point in time so they can receive a CDC-sponsored message. Messages may be delivered multiple times within a few days after crossing through a geofenced area, though CDC will limit the number of times an individual would receive a message. Additionally, CDC requires that individuals always have the option to opt-out of messaging, including any ads that are delivered in real-time and shortly thereafter."

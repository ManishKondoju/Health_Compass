    "text": "Exams and Tests The best test for COPD is a lung function test called spirometry . This involves blowing out as hard as possible into a small machine that tests air movement and lung capacity. The results can be checked right away. Using a stethoscope to listen to the lungs can also be helpful, showing prolonged expiratory time or wheezing. But sometimes, the lungs sound normal, even when a person has COPD. Imaging tests of the lungs, such as x-rays and CT scans may be ordered. With an x-ray, the lungs may look normal, even when a person has COPD. A CT scan will almost always show signs of COPD if it is present. Sometimes, a blood test called arterial blood gas may be done to measure the amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. If your health care provider suspects you have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a blood test will likely be ordered to detect this condition.",

    "text": "Treatment There is no cure for COPD. But there are many things you can do to relieve symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse. If you smoke, now is the time to quit . This is the best way to slow lung damage. Medicines used to treat COPD include: Quick-relief drugs to help open the airways Control drugs to reduce lung inflammation Anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce swelling in the airways Certain long-term antibiotics In severe cases or during flare-ups, you may need to receive: Steroids by mouth or through a vein (intravenously) Bronchodilators through a nebulizer Oxygen therapy Assistance from a machine to help breathing by using a mask or through the use of an endotracheal tube Your provider may prescribe antibiotics during symptom flare-ups , because an infection can make COPD worse. You may need oxygen therapy at home if you have a low level of oxygen in your blood. Pulmonary rehabilitation does not cure COPD. But it can teach you more about the disease, train you to breathe in a different way so you can stay active and feel better, and keep you functioning at the highest level possible. LIVING WITH COPD You can do things every day to keep COPD from getting worse, protect your lungs, and stay healthy. Walk to build up strength: Ask the provider or respiratory therapist how far to walk. Slowly increase how far you walk. Avoid talking if you get short of breath when you walk. Use pursed lip breathing when you breathe out, to empty your lungs before the next breath. Things you can do to make it easier for yourself around the home include: Avoid very cold air or very hot weather Make sure no one smokes in your home Reduce air pollution by not using the fireplace and getting rid of other irritants Manage stress and your mood Use oxygen if prescribed for you Eat healthy foods, including fish, poultry, and lean meat, as well as fruits and vegetables. If it is hard to keep your weight up, talk to a provider or dietitian about eating foods with more calories, by eating small frequent meals. Surgery or other interventions may be used to treat COPD. Only a few people benefit from these surgical treatments: One-way valves can be inserted with a bronchoscopy to help deflate parts of the lung that are hyperinflated (overinflated) in select patients.

You feel it when you slam on the brakes, have a fight with your partner, or ski down a steep slope. It helps you manage dangerous situations. It also occurs when you do something new or exciting. All people have acute stress at one time or another. Chronic stress. This is stress that lasts for a longer period of time. You may have chronic stress if you have money problems, an unhappy marriage, trouble at work, or significant health concerns. Any type of stress that goes on for weeks or months is chronic stress. You can become so used to chronic stress that you dont realize it is a problem. If you dont find ways to manage stress , it may lead to health problems. STRESS AND YOUR BODY Your body reacts to stress by releasing hormones. These hormones make your brain more alert, cause your muscles to tense, and increase your pulse. In the short term, these reactions are good because they can help you handle the situation causing stress. This is your bodys way of protecting itself. When you have chronic stress, your body stays alert, even though there is no danger. Over time, this puts you at risk for health problems, including: High blood pressure Heart disease Diabetes Obesity Depression or anxiety Skin problems, such as acne or eczema Menstrual problems If you already have a health condition, chronic stress can make it worse. SIGNS OF TOO MUCH STRESS Stress can cause many types of physical and emotional symptoms. Sometimes, you may not realize these symptoms are caused by stress. Here are some signs that stress may be affecting you: Diarrhea or constipation Forgetfulness Frequent aches and pains Headaches Lack of energy or focus Sexual problems Stiff jaw or neck Tiredness Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much Upset stomach Use of alcohol or medicines to relax Weight loss or gain",

The lower spine is usually not affected by RA. The disease often begins slowly. Early symptoms may include: Minor joint pain Stiffness Fatigue Joint symptoms may include: Morning stiffness, which lasts more than 1 hour, is common. Joints may feel warm, tender, and stiff when not used for an hour. Joint pain is often felt in the same joint on both sides of the body. Joints are often swollen. Over time, joints may lose their range of motion and may become deformed. Other symptoms include: Chest pain when taking a breath ( pleurisy ) Dry eyes and mouth ( Sjögren syndrome ) Eye burning, itching, and discharge Nodules under the skin (most often a sign of more severe disease) Numbness, tingling , or burning in the hands and feet Sleep difficulties The diagnosis of RA is made when: You have pain and swelling in 1 or more joints. Pain and swelling have been present for longer than 6 weeks. You have a positive test for rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody. You have an elevated erythrocytesedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Other types of arthritis are not present. Sometimes the diagnosis of RA is made even without all of the conditions shown above if the arthritis is otherwise typical for RA.",

    "text": "Treatment RA most often requires long-term treatment by an expert in arthritis called a rheumatologist. Treatment includes: Medicines Physical therapy Exercise Education to help you understand the nature of RA, your treatment options, and the need for regular follow-up Surgery, if required Early treatment for RA with medicines called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should be used in all patients. This will slow joint destruction and prevent deformities. The activity of the RA should be checked at regular visits to make sure the disease is under control. The goal of treatment is to stop the progression of the RA. MEDICINES Anti-inflammatory medicines: These include aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, naproxen and celecoxib. These medicines work very well to reduce joint swelling and inflammation, but they can have long-term side effects. Therefore, they should be taken only for a short time and in low doses when possible. Since they do not prevent joint damage if used alone, DMARDs should be used as well. Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs): These are often the medicines that are tried first in people with RA. They are prescribed along with rest, strengthening exercise, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Methotrexate is the most commonly used DMARD for RA. Leflunomide and hydroxychloroquine may also be used. Sulfasalazine is a medicine that is often combined with methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy). It may be weeks or months before you see any benefit from these medicines. These medicines may have serious side effects, so you will need frequent blood tests and other monitoring when taking them. Antimalarial medicines -- This group of medicines includes hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). They are most often used along with methotrexate. It may be weeks or months before you see any benefit from these medicines. Corticosteroids -- These medicines work very well to reduce joint swelling and inflammation, but they can have long-term side effects and do not prevent joint damage if used alone. Therefore, they should be taken only for a short time and in low doses when possible. Biologic DMARD agents -- These medicines are designed to affect parts of the immune system that play a role in the disease process of RA. They may be given when other medicines, usually methotrexate, have not worked. Biologic medicines are often added to methotrexate. However, because they are very expensive, insurance approval is generally required. Most of them are given either under the skin or",

However, because they are very expensive, insurance approval is generally required. Most of them are given either under the skin or into a vein. There are now many different types of biologic agents. Biologic and synthetic agents can be very helpful in treating RA. However, people taking these medicines must be watched closely because of uncommon, but serious adverse reactions: Infections from bacteria, viruses, and fungi Skin cancer, but not melanoma Skin reactions Allergic reactions Worsened heart failure Damage to nerves Low white blood cell count SURGERY Surgery may be needed to correct severely damaged joints. Surgery may include: Removal of the joint lining ( synovectomy ) Total joint replacement, in extreme cases, may include total knee replacement or total hip replacement . PHYSICAL THERAPY Range-of-motion exercises and exercise programs prescribed by a physical therapist can delay the loss of joint function and help keep muscles strong. Sometimes, therapists will use special machines to apply deep heat or electrical stimulation to reduce pain and improve joint movement. Other therapies that may help ease joint pain include: Joint protection techniques Heat and cold treatments Splints or orthotic devices to support and align joints Frequent rest periods between activities, as well as 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night NUTRITION Some people with RA may have intolerance or allergies to certain foods. A balanced nutritious diet is recommended. It may be helpful to eat foods rich in fish oils (omega-3 fatty acids). Smoking cigarettes should be stopped. Excessive alcohol should also be avoided.",

    "text": "Causes Osteoporosis is the most common type of bone disease. Osteoporosis increases the risk for breaking a bone. About one half of all women over the age of 50 will have a fracture of the hip, wrist, or vertebrae (bones of the spine) during their lifetime. Spine fractures are the most common. Your body needs the minerals calcium and phosphate to make and keep healthy bones. During your life, your body continues to both reabsorb old bone and create new bone. As long as your body has a good balance of new and old bone, your bones stay healthy and strong. Bone loss occurs when more old bone is reabsorbed than new bone is created. Sometimes, bone loss occurs without any known cause. Other times, bone loss and thin bones run in families. In general, white, older women are the most likely to have bone loss. Brittle, fragile bones can be caused by anything that makes your body reabsorb too much bone, or keeps your body from making enough new bone. As you age, your body may reabsorb calcium and phosphate from your bones instead of keeping these minerals in your bones. This makes your bones weaker. Watch this video about: Osteoporosis A major risk factor is not consuming enough calcium to build new bone tissue . It is important to eat/drink enough high-calcium foods. You also need vitamin D, because it helps your body absorb calcium. Your bones may become brittle and more likely to fracture if: If you do not eat enough food with calcium and vitamin D Your body does not absorb enough calcium and vitamin D from your food, such as after gastric bypass surgery or due to other medical conditions Other causes of bone loss include: A decrease in estrogen in women at the time of menopause and a decrease in testosterone in men as they age Being confined to a bed due to a prolonged illness (mostly affects bones in children) Having certain medical conditions that cause increased inflammation in the body such as Crohn disease or rheumatoid arthritis Taking certain medicines, such as certain seizure medicines, hormone treatments for prostate or breast cancer , and steroid medicines taken for more than 3 months Other risk factors include: Absence of menstrual periods for long periods of time A family history of osteoporosis Drinking a large amount of alcohol Low body weight Smoking Having an",

Your health care provider uses this test to: Diagnose bone loss and osteoporosis. Predict your risk for future bone fractures. See how well an osteoporosis medicine is working. (For this purpose, the DEXA scan is most often repeated every 2 years or longer.) The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends this screening test at least once for women age 65 and older, and for some women younger than age 65 who have an increased risk for osteoporosis. So far, research does not show a need for repeating screening after the test at age 65. A simple spine or hip x-ray may show fracture or collapse of the spinal bones. However, simple x-rays of other bones are not very accurate in predicting whether you are likely to have osteoporosis. A low-radiation spine x-ray called a vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) can be done with a DEXA to better identify fractures that do not have any symptoms. Trabecular bone score (TBS) can also be performed to gauge bone quality and help evaluate fracture risk. You may need blood and urine tests if your provider thinks the cause of your osteoporosis is a medical condition, rather than the slow bone loss that occurs with aging. DEXA scan results compare your bone mineral density with both a young adult who has no bone loss and with people your age and sex. This means that at age 80, almost one third of women with normal age-related bone loss would have osteoporosis, based on their DEXA scan results.",

You have had a bone fracture, and a bone density test shows that you have thin bones, but not osteoporosis. Medicines used to treat osteoporosis include: Bisphosphonates -- the main medicines used to prevent and treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. They can be given by mouth or by intravenous (IV) injection. Denosumab -- lessens bone loss and increases bone density. Given by injection under the skin. Teriparatide or abaloparatide -- man-made forms of a hormone your body makes that increases bone density. Romosozumab -- a newer medicine for more severe bone thinning. Estrogen receptor modulators such as raloxifene. Calcitonin -- a man-made form of a hormone your body makes that increases bone density. Used mainly to treat the acute pain from a spine compression fracture. The length of time a woman should take these medicines depends on her level of risk. Recommendations include: Low fracture risk -- 5 years of oral medicine or 3 years of IV therapy High fracture risk -- 10 years of oral medicine or 6 years of IV therapy Exercise plays a key role in preserving bone density in older adults. Some of the exercises recommended to reduce your chance of a fracture include: Weight-bearing exercises, such as walking, jogging, playing tennis, or dancing for at least 30 minutes, three times per week Free weights, weight machines, stretch bands Balance exercises, that may include tai chi and yoga Rowing machines Avoid any exercise that presents a risk of falling. Also, do not do high-impact exercises that can cause fractures in older adults. Follow these guidelines for getting enough calcium and vitamin D : Adults age 50 and under should have 1,000 mg of calcium and 400 to 800 International Units (IU) of vitamin D a day. Women ages 51 to 70 should have 1,200 mg of calcium and 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D a day. Men ages 51 to 70 should have 1,000 mg of calcium and 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D a day.

Adults over age 70 should have 1,200 mg of calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D a day. Your provider may recommend a calcium supplement . Follow a diet that provides the proper amount of calcium and vitamin D. Use supplements to make up for the shortage only if your diet does not have the recommended amounts. Your provider may recommend higher doses of vitamin D if you have risk factors for osteoporosis or a low level of this vitamin. (Note: Some expert groups are not sure the benefits and safety of these amounts of vitamin D and calcium outweigh their risks. Be sure to discuss with your provider whether supplements are a good choice for you.) Stop unhealthy habits: Quit smoking , if you smoke. Limit your alcohol intake. Too much alcohol can damage your bones. Alcohol consumption also puts you at risk for falling and breaking a bone. It is important to prevent falls by older people. These suggestions can help: Do not take medicines that make you drowsy or unsteady. If you must take them, be extra careful when you are up and moving around. For example, hold on to countertops or sturdy furniture to avoid falling. Remove household hazards, such as throw rugs, to reduce the risk for falls. Leave lights on at night so you can see better when walking around your house. Install and use safety grab bars in the bathroom. Install antislip flooring in bathtubs and showers. Make sure your vision is good. Have your eyes checked once a year by an eye doctor or more often if you notice changes in your vision. Wear shoes that fit well and have low heels. This includes slippers. Slippers that do not have heels can cause you to trip and fall. Do not walk outdoors alone on icy days.

This is a test to check the lining of the esophagus (food pipe), stomach, and first part of the small intestine. It is done with a small camera (flexible endoscope) that is inserted down the throat. This test most often requires sedation given through a vein. In some cases, a smaller endoscope may be used that is passed into the stomach through the nose. This does not require sedation. EGD is done on most people when peptic ulcers are suspected or when you have: Low blood count (anemia) Trouble swallowing Bloody vomit Bloody or dark and tarry-looking stools Lost weight without trying Other findings that raise a concern for cancer in the stomach Testing for H pylori is also needed. This may be done by biopsy of the stomach during endoscopy, with a stool test, or by a urea breath test. Other tests you may have include: Hemoglobin blood test to check for anemia Stool occult blood test to test for blood in your stool Sometimes, you may need a test called an upper GI series. A series of x-rays are taken after you drink a thick substance that contains barium. This does not require sedation.",

Reduce acid levels in the stomach. These include H2 blockers such as ranitidine (Zantac), or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) such as omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), esomeprazole (Nexium), rabeprazole (AcipHex) or pantoprazole (Protonix). Take all of your medicines as you have been told. Other changes in your lifestyle can also help. If you have a peptic ulcer with an H pylori infection, the standard treatment uses different combinations of the following medicines for 7 to 14 days: Two different antibiotics to kill H pylori. PPIs such as omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), or esomeprazole (Nexium). Bismuth subsalicylate (the main ingredient in Pepto-Bismol) may be added to help kill the bacteria. You will likely need to take a PPI for 8 weeks if: You have an ulcer without an H pylori infection. Your ulcer is caused by taking aspirin or NSAIDs. Your provider may also prescribe this type of medicine regularly if you continue taking aspirin or NSAIDs for other health conditions. Other medicines used for ulcers are: Misoprostol, a medicine that may help prevent ulcers in people who take NSAIDs on a regular basis Medicines that protect the tissue lining, such as sucralfate If a peptic ulcer bleeds a lot, an EGD may be needed to stop the bleeding. Methods used to stop the bleeding include: Injecting medicine in the ulcer Applying metal clips or heat therapy to the ulcer Surgery may be needed if: Bleeding cannot be stopped with an EGD The ulcer has caused a tear in the stomach or duodenum",

Follow your providers instructions on taking medicines, eliminating asthma triggers, and monitoring symptoms. MEDICINES FOR ASTHMA There are two kinds of medicines for treating asthma: Long term or control medicines to help prevent attacks Quick-relief (rescue) medicines for use during attacks LONG-TERM MEDICINES These are also called maintenance or control medicines. They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take these medicines every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK. Some long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your provider will prescribe the right medicine for you. QUICK-RELIEF MEDICINES These are also called rescue medicines. They are taken: For coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or during an asthma attack Just before physical activity to help prevent asthma symptoms Tell your provider if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more. If so, your asthma may not be under control. Your provider may change the dose or your daily asthma control medicine to reduce the use of quick-relief medicines. Quick-relief medicines include: Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators Oral corticosteroids for a severe asthma attack A severe asthma attack requires a visit to a provider. You may also need a hospital stay. There, you will likely be given oxygen, breathing assistance, and medicines given through a vein (IV). ASTHMA CARE AT HOME You can take steps to decrease the possibility of asthma attacks: Know the asthma symptoms to watch for . Know how to take your peak flow reading and what it means. Know which triggers make your asthma worse and what to do when it happens. Know how to care of your asthma before and during physical activity or exercise . Asthma action plans are written documents for managing asthma.

    "text": "Prevention You can reduce asthma symptoms by avoiding triggers and substances that irritate the airways. Cover bedding with allergy-proof casings to reduce exposure to dust mites. Remove carpets from bedrooms and vacuum regularly. Use only unscented detergents and cleaning materials in the home. Keep humidity levels low and fix leaks to reduce the growth of organisms such as mold. Keep the house clean and keep food in containers and out of bedrooms. This helps reduce the possibility of cockroaches. Body parts and droppings from cockroaches can trigger asthma attacks in some people. If someone is allergic to an animal that cannot be removed from the home, the animal should be kept out of the bedroom. Place filtering material over the heating/air conditioning outlets in your home to trap animal dander. Change the filter in furnaces and air conditioners often. Eliminate tobacco smoke from the home. This is the single most important thing a family can do to help someone with asthma. Smoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke outside carry smoke residue inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms. If you smoke, now is a good time to quit. Avoid air pollution, industrial dust, and irritating fumes as much as possible.",

This is called essential hypertension. High blood pressure that is caused by another medical condition or medicine you are taking is called secondary hypertension. Secondary hypertension may be due to: Chronic kidney disease Disorders of the adrenal gland (such as pheochromocytoma or Cushing syndrome ) Hyperparathyroidism Pregnancy or preeclampsia Medicines such as birth control pills, diet pills, some cold medicines, migraine medicines, corticosteroids, some antipsychotics, and certain medicines used to treat cancer Narrowed artery that supplies blood to the kidney ( renal artery stenosis ) Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)",

    "text": "Exams and Tests Diagnosing and treating high blood pressure early can help prevent heart disease, stroke, eye problems, and chronic kidney disease. Your provider will measure your blood pressure several times before diagnosing you with high blood pressure. It is normal for your blood pressure to be different based on the time of day. All adults age 18 or older should have their blood pressure checked periodically. For people age 40 or older, checking blood pressure once per year is recommended. For some people age 18 to 39, checking less often may be fine. More frequent measurements may be needed for those with a history of high blood pressure readings or those with risk factors for high blood pressure. Check with your provider about what is best for you. Blood pressure readings taken at home may be a better measure of your current blood pressure than those taken at your providers office. Make sure you get a good quality, well-fitting home blood pressure monitor . It should have a properly sized cuff and a digital readout. Practice with your provider to make sure you are taking your blood pressure correctly. You should be relaxed and seated for five or more minutes prior to taking a reading. Bring your home monitor to your appointments so your provider can make sure it is working correctly. Your provider will do a physical exam to look for signs of heart disease, damage to your eyes, and other changes in your body. Tests may also be done to look for: High cholesterol level Heart disease, using tests such as an echocardiogram or electrocardiogram Diabetes and kidney disease, using tests such as a basic metabolic panel blood test, urinalysis , or ultrasound of the kidneys",

    "text": "Treatment The goal of treatment is to reduce your blood pressure so that you have a lower risk of health problems caused by high blood pressure. You and your provider should set a blood pressure goal for you. Whenever thinking about the best treatment for high blood pressure, you and your provider must consider other factors such as: Your age The medicines you take Your risk of side effects from possible medicines Other medical conditions you may have, such as a history of heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, or diabetes If the top blood pressure number is from 120 to 129 mm Hg, and the bottom blood pressure number is less than 80 mm Hg, you have what is called elevated blood pressure. Your provider will recommend lifestyle changes to bring your blood pressure down to a normal range. Medicines are rarely used at this stage. If your blood pressure is 130/80 or higher, but lower than 140/90 mm Hg, you have Stage 1 high blood pressure. When thinking about the best treatment, you and your provider must consider: If you have no other diseases or risk factors for heart or kidney disease, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and repeat the measurements after a few months. If your blood pressure remains 130/80 or above, but lower than 140/90 mm Hg, your provider may recommend medicines to treat high blood pressure. If you have other diseases or risk factors for heart or kidney disease, your provider may be more likely to recommend medicines at the same time as lifestyle changes. If your blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, you have Stage 2 high blood pressure. Your provider will most likely recommend medicines and lifestyle changes together. Before making a final diagnosis of either elevated blood pressure or high blood pressure, your provider should ask you to have your blood pressure measured at home, at your pharmacy, or somewhere else besides their office or a hospital. LIFESTYLE CHANGES You can do many things to help control your blood pressure, including: Eat a heart-healthy diet , including potassium and fiber. Drink plenty of water. Get at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise per week. If you smoke or use tobacco, quit. Limit how much alcohol you drink to 1 drink a day for women, and 2 drinks a day for men or less and consider quitting entirely.",

Limit how much alcohol you drink to 1 drink a day for women, and 2 drinks a day for men or less and consider quitting entirely. Limit the amount of sodium (salt) you eat. Aim for less than 1,500 mg per day of sodium. Reduce stress. Try to avoid things that cause you stress, and try meditation or yoga to de-stress. Stay at a healthy body weight. Your provider can help you find programs for losing weight, stopping smoking, and exercising. You can also get a referral to a dietitian, who can help you plan a diet that is healthy for you. How low your blood pressure should be and at what level you need to start treatment is individualized, based on your age and any medical problems you have. Ask your provider what your blood pressure goal is. MEDICINES FOR HYPERTENSION Most of the time, your provider will suggest you try lifestyle changes first and check your blood pressure two or more times. Medicines will likely be recommended if your blood pressure readings remain at or above these levels: Top number (systolic pressure) of 130 or more Bottom number (diastolic pressure) of 80 or more If you have diabetes, heart problems, or a history of a stroke, medicines may be started at lower blood pressure reading. The most commonly used blood pressure targets for people with these medical problems are below 120 to 130/80 mm Hg. There are many different medicines to treat high blood pressure . Often, a single blood pressure medicine may not be enough to control your blood pressure, and you may need to take two or more medicines. It is very important that you take the medicines prescribed to you. If you have side effects, tell your provider promptly so they can substitute a different medicine.",

    "text": "Treatment Your health care provider must first decide if the infection is just in the bladder, or if it has spread to the kidneys and how severe it is. MILD BLADDER AND KIDNEY INFECTIONS Most of the time, you will need to take an antibiotic to prevent the infection from spreading to the kidneys. For a simple bladder infection, you will take antibiotics for 1 to 5 days (women) or 7 to 14 days (men). The length of treatment depends on the antibiotic used. If you are pregnant or have diabetes, or have a mild kidney infection, you will most often take antibiotics for 7 to 14 days. Finish all of the antibiotics, even if you feel better. If you do not finish the whole dose of medicine, the infection may return and be harder to treat later. Always drink plenty of water when you have a bladder or kidney infection. Tell your provider if you might be pregnant before taking these medicines. RECURRENT BLADDER INFECTIONS Some women have repeated bladder infections. Your provider may suggest that you: Take a single dose of an antibiotic after sexual contact to prevent an infection. Have a 3 to 5 day course of antibiotics at home to use if you develop an infection. Take a single, daily dose of an antibiotic to prevent infections. MORE SEVERE KIDNEY INFECTIONS You may need to go into the hospital if you are very sick and cannot take medicines by mouth or drink enough fluids. You may also be admitted to the hospital if you: Are an older adult Have kidney stones or changes in the anatomy of your urinary tract Have recently had urinary tract surgery Have cancer, diabetes, multiple sclerosis , spinal cord injury, or other medical problems Are pregnant and have a fever or are otherwise ill At the hospital, you will receive fluids and antibiotics through a vein. Some people have UTIs that do not go away with treatment or keep coming back. These are called chronic UTIs. If you have a chronic UTI, you may need stronger antibiotics or to take medicine for a longer time. You may need surgery if the infection is caused by a problem with the structure of the urinary tract.",

The most common are: Chocolate Dairy foods, especially certain cheeses Foods with monosodium glutamate (MSG) Foods with tyramine, which includes red wine, aged cheese, smoked fish, chicken livers, figs, and certain beans Fruits (avocado, banana, citrus fruit) Meats containing nitrates (bacon, hot dogs, salami, cured meats) Onions Peanuts and other nuts and seeds Processed, fermented, pickled, or marinated foods True migraine headaches are not a result of a brain tumor or other serious medical problem.

    "text": "Symptoms There are two main types of migraines: Migraine with aura (classic migraine) Migraine without aura (common migraine) An aura is a group of nervous system (neurologic) symptoms. These symptoms are considered a warning sign that a migraine is coming. Most often, the vision is affected and can include any or all of the following: Temporary blind spots or colored spots Blurred vision Eye pain Seeing stars, zigzag lines, or flashing lights Tunnel vision (only able to see objects close to the center of the field of view) Other nervous system symptoms include yawning, difficulty concentrating, nausea, trouble finding the right words, dizziness, weakness, numbness, and tingling. Some of these symptoms are much less common with migraine headaches. If you have any of these symptoms, your provider will likely order tests to find the cause. An aura often occurs 10 to 15 minutes before the headache, but can occur just a few minutes to 24 hours before. A headache does not always follow an aura. The headaches usually: Start as a dull ache and get worse within minutes to hours Are throbbing, pounding, or pulsating Are worse on one side of the head with pain behind the eye or in the back of the head and neck Last 4 to 72 hours Other symptoms that may occur with the headache include: Chills Increased urination Fatigue Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Sensitivity to light or sound Sweating Symptoms may linger, even after the migraine goes away. This is called a migraine hangover. Symptoms can include: Feeling mentally dull, like your thinking is not clear or sharp Needing more sleep Neck pain",

A complete physical and neurological exam will be done to determine if your headaches are due to muscle tension, sinus problems, or a different brain disorder. There is no specific test to prove that your headache is actually a migraine. In most cases, no special tests are needed. Your provider may order a brain CT or MRI scan if you have certain neurologic symptoms with your migraine, including weakness, memory problems, or loss of alertness, especially, if you have never had one before. An electroencephalogram (EEG) may be needed to check for seizures. A lumbar puncture (spinal tap) might be done.",

    "text": "Treatment There is no specific cure for migraine headaches. The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers. A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home . A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your provider can plan how to avoid these triggers. Lifestyle changes include: Healthier sleep habits, such as getting enough sleep and going to bed at the same time each night Healthier eating habits, including not skipping meals and avoiding your food triggers Managing stress Losing weight, if youre overweight If you have frequent migraines, your provider may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include: Antidepressants Blood pressure medicines, such as beta blockers Anti-seizure medicines Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) agents Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month. Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your provider to see if riboflavin or magnesium is right for you. Some of these medicines may not be safe for a pregnant or breast-feeding woman to take. TREATING AN ATTACK Hydration with fluids is often helpful, with or without the use of medicines. Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, naproxen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that: Taking pain medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine. Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver. Too much naproxen, ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or damage your kidneys. If these treatments do not help, ask your provider about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections. The group of medicines most often used is called triptans. Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your provider before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your provider about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Other medicines treat",

They may be used alone or along with the other medicines that treat the migraine itself. Feverfew is an herb that may be used for migraines. It can be effective for some people. Before using feverfew, make sure your provider approves. Herbal remedies sold in drugstores and health food stores are not regulated. Work with a trained herbalist when selecting herbs. PREVENTING MIGRAINE HEADACHES If your migraines occur more than twice a week, your provider may recommend medicines to take every day, which may help prevent your migraines. The goal is to reduce how often migraines occur and how severe the headache is. These types of medicines may help prevent or reduce migraine headaches: Medicines commonly used for high blood pressure (such as beta-blockers, angiotensin blockade agents, and calcium channel blockers) Certain medicines that are also used to treat depression Certain medicines also used to treat seizures, called anticonvulsants Botulinum toxin type A injections for select people Medicines that block calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) Newer devices that provide different kinds of nerve stimulation or magnetic stimulation are also being evaluated for treatment of migraine headaches.

This means it doesnt spread to other people. Psoriasis seems to be inherited through families, at least to some degree. Normal skin cells grow deep in the skin and rise to the surface about once a month. When you have psoriasis, on average this process takes place within 7 to14 days. This results in dead skin cells building up on the skins surface, forming the collections of scales. The following may trigger an attack of psoriasis or make it harder to treat: Infections from bacteria or viruses, including strep throat and upper respiratory infections Dry air or dry skin Injury to the skin, including cuts, burns, insect bites, and other skin rashes Some medicines, including antimalaria medicines, beta-blockers, and lithium Stress Too little sunlight Too much sunlight (sunburn) Psoriasis may be worse in people who have a weak immune system, including people with HIV/AIDS. Some people with psoriasis also have arthritis ( psoriatic arthritis ). People with psoriasis have an increased risk for fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disorders, such as heart disease and stroke .",

Plaques are most often seen on the elbows, knees, and middle of the body. But they can appear anywhere, including on the scalp, palms, soles of the feet, and genitals. The skin may be: Itchy Dry and covered with silver, flaky skin (scales) Pink-red in color Raised and thick Other symptoms may include: Joint or tendon pain or aching Nail changes , including thick nails, yellow-brown nails, small pits in the nail, and a lifting of the nail from the skin underneath Severe dandruff on the scalp There are five main types of psoriasis: Erythrodermic -- The skin redness is very intense and covers a large area. Guttate -- Small, pink-red spots appear on the skin. This form is often linked to strep infections, especially in children. Inverse -- Skin redness and irritation occur in the armpits, groin, and in between overlapping skin rather than the more common areas of the elbows and knees. Plaque -- Thick, red patches of skin are covered by flaky, silver-white scales. This is the most common type of psoriasis. Pustular -- Yellow pus-filled blisters (pustules) are surrounded by red, irritated skin.",

    "text": "Treatment The goal of treatment is to regulate your symptoms and prevent infection. Three treatment options are available: Skin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos -- These are called topical treatments. Pills or injections that affect the bodys immune response, not just the skin -- These are called systemic or body-wide treatments. Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis. TREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL) Most of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp. These may include: Corticosteroid creams and ointments Other anti-inflammatory creams and ointments Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin Creams to remove the scaling (usually salicylic acid or lactic acid) Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription) Moisturizers Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids) SYSTEMIC (BODY-WIDE) TREATMENTS If you have moderate to severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune systems faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids such as acitretin can also be used. Newer medicines, called biologics, are more commonly used as they more specifically target the causes of psoriasis. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include: Adalimumab (Humira) Abatacept (Orencia) Apremilast (Otezla) Brodalumab (Siliq) Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia) Etanercept (Enbrel) Infliximab (Remicade) Ixekizumab (Taltz) Golimumab (Simponi) Guselkumab (Tremfya) Risankizumab-rzaa (Skyrizi) Secukinumab (Cosentyx) Tildrakizumab-asmn (Ilumya) Ustekinumab (Stelara) PHOTOTHERAPY Some people may choose to have phototherapy, which is safe and can be very effective: This is treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light. It may be given alone or after you take a medicine that makes the skin sensitive to light. Phototherapy for psoriasis can be given as ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light. OTHER TREATMENTS If you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics. HOME CARE Following these tips at home may help: Taking a daily bath or shower -- Try not to scrub too hard, because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack. Oatmeal baths may be soothing and may help to loosen scales. You can use over-the-counter oatmeal bath products. Or, you can mix 1 cup (85 grams) of oatmeal into a tub (bath) of warm water. Keeping your skin clean and moist and avoiding your specific psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups. Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburned.

    "text": "Exams and Tests Symptoms of MS may mimic those of many other nervous system problems. MS is diagnosed by determining if there are signs of more than one attack on the brain or spinal cord and by ruling out other conditions. People who have a form of MS called relapsing-remitting MS have evidence of at least two attacks separated by a remission. In other people, the disease may slowly get worse in between clear attacks. This form is called secondary progressive MS. A form with gradual progression, but no clear attacks is called primary progressive MS. Your health care provider may suspect MS if there are decreases in the function of two different parts of the central nervous system (such as abnormal reflexes) at two different times. An exam of the nervous system may show reduced nerve function in one area of the body. Or the reduced nerve function may be spread over many parts of the body. This may include: Abnormal nerve reflexes Decreased ability to move a part of the body Decreased or abnormal sensation Other loss of nervous system functions, such as vision An eye exam may show: Abnormal pupil responses Changes in the visual fields Changes in eye movements Damage to the nerve in the eye ( optic nerve atrophy ) Decreased visual acuity Problems with the inside parts of the eye Rapid eye movements triggered when the eye moves Tests to diagnose MS include: Blood tests to check for other conditions that are similar to MS. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests, including CSF oligoclonal banding may be needed. MRI scan of the brain , or the spine, or both are important to help diagnose and follow MS. Nerve function study (evoked potential test, such as visual evoked response) is less often used.",

A tension headache : May be related to stress, depression, anxiety, a head injury, or holding your head and neck in an abnormal position. Tends to be on both sides of your head. It often starts at the back of the head and spreads forward. The pain may feel dull or squeezing, like a tight band or vice. Your shoulders, neck, or jaw may feel tight or sore. A migraine headache involves pain that is throbbing, pounding, or pulsating, and is on one side of your head. It often occurs with other symptoms, such as vision changes, sensitivity to sound or light, or nausea. With a migraine: The headache may be associated with an aura. This is a group of warning symptoms that start before your headache. The pain usually gets worse as you try to move around. Migraines may be triggered by foods, such as chocolate, certain cheeses, or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Caffeine withdrawal, lack of sleep, and alcohol may also be triggers. Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They often occur from overuse of pain medicines for other headaches like migraine or tension headaches. For this reason, these headaches are also called medicine overuse headaches. People who take pain medicine more than 3 days a week on a regular basis can develop this type of headache. Other types of headaches: Cluster headache is a sharp, very painful headache that occurs daily, sometimes up to several times a day for months. It then goes away for weeks to months. In some people, the headaches never come back. The headache usually lasts less than an hour. It tends to occur at the same times every day. Sinus headache causes pain in the front of the head and face. It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes. The pain is worse when you bend forward and when you first wake up in the morning. Headaches may occur if you have a cold, the flu, a fever, or premenstrual syndrome . Headache due to a disorder called temporal arteritis . This is a swollen, inflamed artery that supplies blood to part of the head, temple, and neck area. In rare cases, a headache can be a sign of something",

When migraine symptoms begin: Drink water to avoid getting dehydrated, especially if you have vomited. Rest in a quiet, dark room. Place a cool cloth on your head. Use any relaxation techniques you have learned. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. When you get a headache, write down the following: Day and time the pain began What you ate and drank over the past 24 hours How much you slept What you were doing and where you were right before the pain started How long the headache lasted and what made it stop Review your diary with your health care provider to identify triggers or a pattern to your headaches. This can help you and your provider create a treatment plan. Knowing your triggers can help you avoid them. Your provider may have already prescribed medicine to treat your type of headache. If so, take the medicine as instructed. For tension headaches, try acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. Talk to your provider if you are taking pain medicines 3 or more days a week.",

To help resolve symptoms of benign positional vertigo, the provider may perform the Epley maneuver on you. This involves placing your head in different positions to help reset the balance organ. You may be prescribed medicines to treat symptoms of peripheral vertigo, such as nausea and vomiting. Physical therapy may help improve balance problems. Youll be taught exercises to restore your sense of balance. Exercises can also strengthen your muscles to help prevent falls . To prevent worsening of symptoms during an episode of vertigo , try the following: Keep still. Sit or lie down when symptoms occur. Gradually resume activity. Avoid sudden position changes. Do not try to read when symptoms occur. Avoid bright lights. You may need help walking when symptoms occur. Avoid hazardous activities such as driving, operating heavy machinery, and climbing until 1 week after symptoms have disappeared. Other treatment depends on the cause of the vertigo. Surgery may be suggested in some cases.",

    "text": "Considerations Depression can occur in people of all ages: Adults Teenagers Older adults Symptoms of depression include: Agitation, restlessness, irritability, and anger Becoming withdrawn or isolated Fatigue and lack of energy Feeling hopeless, helpless, worthless, guilty, and self-hate Loss of interest or pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed including sex Sudden change in appetite, often with weight gain or loss Thoughts of death or suicide Trouble concentrating Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much Remember that children may have different symptoms than adults. Watch for changes in schoolwork, sleep, and behavior. If you wonder whether your child might be depressed, talk with your health care provider. Your provider can help you learn how to help your child with depression . The main types of depression include: Major depression -- It occurs when feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration interfere with daily life for 2 weeks or longer periods of time. Persistent depressive disorder -- This is a depressed mood that lasts 2 years. Over that length of time, you may have periods of major depression, with times when your symptoms are milder. Other common forms of depression include: Postpartum depression -- Many women feel somewhat down after having a baby. However, true postpartum depression is more severe and includes the symptoms of major depression. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) -- Symptoms of depression occur 1 week before your period and disappear after you menstruate. Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) -- This occurs most often during fall and winter, and disappears during spring and summer. It is most likely due to a lack of sunlight. Major depression with psychotic features -- This occurs when a person has depression and loss of touch with reality ( psychosis ). Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic depression) -- This occurs when depression alternates with mania. Bipolar disorder has depression as one of its symptoms, but it is a different type of mental illness.",

The rash is often itchy and forms blisters that ooze and crust over. In older children and adults, the rash is more often seen on the inside of the knees and elbow. It can also appear on the neck, hands, and feet. In adults, the rash may be limited to the hands, eyelids, or genitals. Rashes may occur anywhere on the body during a bad outbreak. Intense itching is common. Itching may start even before the rash appears. Atopic dermatitis is often called the itch that rashes because the itching starts, and then the skin rash follows as a result of scratching.",

    "text": "Treatment SKIN CARE AT HOME Daily skin care may cut down on the need for medicines. To help you avoid scratching your rash or skin: Use a moisturizer, topical steroid cream, or other medicine your provider prescribes. Take antihistamine medicines by mouth to reduce severe itching. Keep your fingernails cut short. Wear light gloves during sleep if nighttime scratching is a problem. Keep your skin moist by using lotions, creams, or ointments (such as petroleum jelly) 2 to 3 times a day. Choose skin products that do not contain alcohol, scents, dyes, and other chemicals. A humidifier to keep home air moist will also help. Avoid things that make symptoms worse, such as: Foods, such as eggs, that may cause an allergic reaction in a very young child (always talk to your provider first) Irritants, such as wool and lanolin Strong soaps or detergents, as well as chemicals and solvents Sudden changes in body temperature and stress, which may cause sweating Triggers that cause allergy symptoms When washing or bathing: Expose your skin to water for as short a time as possible. Short, cooler baths are better than long, hot baths. Use gentle body washes and cleansers instead of regular soaps. Do not scrub or dry your skin too hard or for too long. Apply lubricating lotions, creams, or ointment to your skin while it is still damp after bathing. This will help trap moisture in your skin. MEDICINES At this time, allergy shots are not used to treat atopic dermatitis. Antihistamines taken by mouth may help with itching or allergies. You can often buy these medicines without a prescription. Atopic dermatitis is usually treated with medicines placed directly on the skin or scalp. These are called topical medicines: You will probably be prescribed a mild corticosteroid cream or ointment at first (such as hydrocortisone). You may need a stronger medicine if this does not work. Medicines called topical immunomodulators (TIMs) may be prescribed for anyone over 2 years old. Ask your provider about concerns over a possible cancer risk with the use of these medicines. Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin may be used for thickened areas. Barrier repair creams containing ceramides may be used. Wet-wrap treatment with topical corticosteroids may help regulate the condition. But, it may lead to an infection. Other treatments that may be used include: Antibiotic creams or pills if your skin",

Your provider may need to repeat testing your hormone levels several times to confirm your menopausal status if you have not completely stopped menstruating. Tests that may be done include: Estradiol Follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) Luteinizing hormone ( LH ) Your provider will perform a pelvic exam. Decreased estrogen can cause changes in the lining of the vagina. Bone loss increases during the first few years after your last period. Your provider may order a bone density test to look for bone loss related to osteoporosis. This bone density test is recommended for all women at age 65 if they have not already had it. This test may be recommended sooner if you are at higher risk for osteoporosis because of your family history or medicines that you take.",

Treatment depends on many factors such as: How bad your symptoms are Your overall health Your preferences HORMONE THERAPY HT may help if you have severe hot flashes, night sweats, mood issues, or vaginal dryness. HT is treatment with estrogen and, sometimes, progesterone. Talk to your provider about the benefits and risks of HT. Your provider should be aware of your entire medical and family history before prescribing HT. Several major studies have questioned the health benefits and risks of HT, including the risk of developing breast cancer, heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots. However, using HT for the 10 years after developing menopause is associated with a lower chance of death. Current guidelines support the use of HT for the treatment of hot flashes. Specific recommendations are: HT may be started in women who have recently entered menopause. HT should not be used in women who started menopause many years ago, except for vaginal estrogen treatments. HT should not be used for longer than necessary. Some women may require prolonged estrogen use due to troublesome hot flashes. This is safe in healthy women. Women taking HT should have a low risk for stroke, heart disease, blood clots, or breast cancer. To reduce the risks of estrogen therapy, your provider may recommend: A lower dose of estrogen or a different estrogen preparation (for instance, a vaginal cream or skin patch rather than a pill). Using patches appears to be safer than oral estrogen, as it avoids the increased risk for blood clots seen with oral estrogen use. Frequent and regular physical exams, including breast exams and mammograms Women who still have a uterus (that is, have not had surgery to remove it for any reason) should take estrogen combined with progesterone to prevent cancer of the lining of the uterus (endometrial cancer). ALTERNATIVES TO HORMONE THERAPY There are other medicines that can help with mood swings, hot flashes, and other symptoms. These include: Antidepressants, including paroxetine (Paxil), venlafaxine (Effexor), bupropion (Wellbutrin), and fluoxetine (Prozac) A blood pressure medicine called clonidine Gabapentin, a seizure drug that also helps reduce hot flashes DIET AND LIFESTYLE CHANGES Lifestyle steps you can take to reduce menopause symptoms include: Diet changes: Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods. Eat soy containing foods. Soy contains estrogen. Get plenty of calcium and vitamin D in food or supplements. Exercise",

    "text": "Treatment The underlying cause often cannot be cured. The goal of treatment is to: Reduce pain and inflammation Improve function Prevent further joint damage LIFESTYLE CHANGES Lifestyle changes are the preferred treatment for osteoarthritis and other types of joint swelling. Exercise can help relieve stiffness, reduce pain and fatigue, and improve muscle and bone strength. Your health care team can help you design an exercise program that is best for you. Exercise programs may include: Low-impact aerobic activity (also called endurance exercise) such as walking Range of motion exercises for flexibility Strength training for muscle tone Your provider may suggest physical therapy. This might include: Heat or ice. Splints or orthotics to support joints and help improve their position. This is often needed for rheumatoid arthritis. Water therapy. Massage. Other things you can do include: Get plenty of sleep. Sleeping 8 to 10 hours a night and taking naps during the day can help you recover from a flare-up more quickly, and may even help prevent flare-ups. Avoid staying in one position for too long. Avoid positions or movements that place extra stress on your sore joints. Change your home to make activities easier. For example, install grab bars in the shower, the tub, and near the toilet. Try stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, yoga, or tai chi. Eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, which contain important vitamins and minerals. Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as cold-water fish (salmon, mackerel, and herring), flaxseed, rapeseed (canola) oil, soybeans, soybean oil, pumpkin seeds, and walnuts. Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. Apply capsaicin cream over your painful joints. You may feel improvement after applying the cream for 3 to 7 days. Lose weight, if you are overweight. Weight loss can greatly improve joint pain in the legs and feet. Use a cane to reduce pain from hip, knee, ankle, or foot arthritis. MEDICINES Medicines may be prescribed along with lifestyle changes. All medicines have some risks. You should be closely followed by a provider when taking arthritis medicines , even ones you buy over-the-counter. Over-the-counter medicines: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is often the first medicine tried to reduce pain. Take up to 3,000 mg a day (2 extra-strength Tylenol every 8 hours).

To prevent damage to your liver, do not take more than the recommended dose. Since multiple medicines are available without a prescription that also contain acetaminophen, you will need to include them in the 3,000 mg per day maximum. Also, avoid alcohol when taking acetaminophen. Aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that can relieve arthritis pain. However, they can carry risks when used for a long time. Possible side effects include heart attack, stroke, stomach ulcers, bleeding from the digestive tract, and kidney damage. Depending on the type of arthritis, a number of other medicines may be prescribed: Corticosteroids (steroids) help reduce inflammation. They may be injected into painful joints or given by mouth. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used to treat autoimmune arthritis and SLE Biologics and kinase inhibitors are used for the treatment of autoimmune arthritis. They may be given by injection or by mouth. For gout, certain medicines to lower uric acid levels may be used. It is very important to take your medicines as directed by your provider. If you are having problems doing so (for example, because of side effects), you should talk to your provider. Also make sure your provider knows about all the medicines you are taking, including vitamins and supplements bought without a prescription. SURGERY AND OTHER TREATMENTS In some cases, surgery may be done if other treatments have not worked and severe damage to a joint occurs.

    "text": "Causes There are two major types of stroke: Ischemic stroke Hemorrhagic stroke Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This may happen in two ways: A clot may form in an artery that is already very narrow. This is called a thrombotic stroke . A clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain. This is called cerebral embolism, or an embolic stroke. Ischemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries. Watch this video about: Stroke A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. This causes blood to leak into the brain. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. These defects may include: Aneurysm (weak area in the wall of a blood vessel that causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out) Arteriovenous malformation (AVM abnormal connection between the arteries and veins) Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA condition in which proteins called amyloid build up on the walls of the arteries in the brain) Hemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and warfarin or has a bleeding disorder. Very high blood pressure may cause blood vessels to burst, leading to hemorrhagic stroke. An ischemic stroke can develop bleeding and become a hemorrhagic stroke. High blood pressure is the main risk factor for strokes . Other major risk factors are: Irregular heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation Diabetes Smoking Family history of stroke Being male High cholesterol Increasing age, especially after age 55 Ethnicity (African Americans are more likely to die of a stroke) Obesity History of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops for a brief time) Stroke risk is also higher in: People who have heart disease or poor blood flow in their legs caused by narrowed arteries People who have unhealthy lifestyle habits such as excessive use of alcohol, use of recreational drugs, a high-fat diet, or lack of exercise People who have a hereditary tendency to develop blood clots Women who take birth control pills (especially those who smoke and are",

Most of the time, symptoms develop suddenly and without warning. But symptoms may occur on and off for the first day or two. Symptoms are usually most severe when the stroke first happens, but they may slowly get worse. A headache may occur if the stroke is caused by bleeding in the brain. The headache: Starts suddenly and may be severe May be worse when you are lying flat May wake you up from sleep May get worse when you change positions or when you bend, strain, or cough Other symptoms depend on how severe the stroke is, and what part of the brain is affected. Symptoms may include: Change in alertness (including sleepiness, unconsciousness, and coma) Changes in hearing or taste Changes that affect touch and the ability to feel pain, pressure, or different temperatures Confusion or loss of memory Problems swallowing Problems writing or reading Dizziness or abnormal feeling of movement (vertigo) Eyesight problems, such as decreased vision, double vision, or total loss of vision Lack of control over the bladder or bowels Loss of balance or coordination, or trouble walking Muscle weakness in the face, arm, or leg (usually just on one side) Numbness or tingling on one side of the body Personality, mood, or emotional changes Trouble speaking or understanding others who are speaking",

Your provider and nurses will repeat this exam over time to see if your stroke is getting worse or improving. Listen to the carotid arteries in the neck with a stethoscope for an abnormal sound, called a bruit, which is caused by abnormal blood flow. Check for high blood pressure and an irregular heartbeat. You may have the following tests to help find the type, location, and cause of the stroke and check for other problems: CT scan or MRI scan of the brain to determine the location of the stroke, and if there is a mass, or any bleeding Angiogram of the head to look for a blood vessel that is blocked or bleeding Carotid duplex (ultrasound) to see if the carotid arteries in your neck have narrowed Echocardiogram to see if the stroke could have been caused by a blood clot from the heart Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or CT angiography to check for abnormal blood vessels in the brain Other tests include: Blood tests Electroencephalogram (EEG) to determine if there are seizures Electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rhythm monitoring",

    "text": "Treatment A stroke is a medical emergency. Quick treatment is needed. Call 911 or the local emergency number right away or seek urgent medical care at the first signs of a stroke. People who are having stroke symptoms need to get to a hospital as quickly as possible. If the stroke is caused by a blood clot, a clot-busting medicine may be given to dissolve the clot (also called thrombolytic therapy). To be effective, this treatment must be started within 4 1/2 hours of when the symptoms first started. However, the sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome. Endovascular thrombectomy may be needed. This is when a catheter is inserted into your arteries. Dye is injected while images of your brains blood vessels are reviewed. A clot, if found, could be removed through the catheter. Other treatments given in the hospital depend on the cause of the stroke. These may include: Blood thinners such as heparin, warfarin, direct acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), aspirin, or clopidogrel (Plavix) Medicine to control risk factors for stroke, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol Special procedures or surgery to relieve symptoms or prevent more strokes Nutrients and fluids Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and swallowing therapy will all begin in the hospital. If the person has severe swallowing problems, a feeding tube in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) will likely be needed. The goal of treatment after a stroke is to help you recover as much function as possible and prevent future strokes. Recovery from your stroke will begin while you are still in the hospital or at a rehab center. It will continue when you go home from the hospital or center. Be sure to follow up with your provider after you go home.",

Many people develop depression after a stroke. This can slow down recovery but is also a very treatable complication of a stroke. Many people who have had a stroke will keep improving in the months or years after their stroke. Over half of people who have a stroke are able to function and live at home. Others are not able to care for themselves. If treatment with clot-busting medicines is successful, the symptoms of a stroke may go away. However, people often do not get to the hospital soon enough to receive these medicines, or they cannot take these medicines because of a health condition. People who have a stroke from a blood clot (ischemic stroke) have a better chance of surviving than those who have a stroke from bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke). The risk for a second stroke is highest during the weeks or months after the first stroke. The risk begins to decrease after this period.",

Check if one side of the face droops. ARMS. Ask the person to raise both arms. See if one arm drifts downward. SPEECH. Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Check if words are slurred and if the sentence is repeated correctly. TIME. If a person shows any of these symptoms, time is essential. It is important to get to the hospital as quickly as possible.

General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise). Hair loss . Weight loss . Mouth sores . Sensitivity to sunlight. Skin rash -- A butterfly rash develops in about half the people with SLE. The rash is mostly seen over the cheeks and bridge of the nose. It can be widespread. It gets worse in sunlight. Swollen lymph nodes .

However, having a positive ANA alone does not mean you have SLE. The health care provider will do a complete physical exam. You may have a rash, arthritis, or swelling in the ankles. There may be an abnormal sound called a pericardial friction rub or pleural friction rub. Your provider will also do a nervous system exam. Tests used to diagnose SLE may include: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) Complete blood count (CBC) with differential Chest x-ray Serum creatinine Urinalysis You may also have other tests to learn more about your condition. Some of these are: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) panel Complement components (C3 and C4) Antibodies to double-stranded DNA C-reactive protein (CRP) Coombs test -- direct Cryoglobulins Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) Kidney function blood tests Liver function blood tests Rheumatoid factor Antiphospholipid antibodies and lupus anticoagulant test Kidney biopsy Imaging tests of the heart, brain, lungs, joints, muscles or intestines",

Severe symptoms that involve the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs often need treatment by specialists. Each person with SLE needs evaluation regarding: How active the disease is What part of the body is affected What form of treatment is needed Mild forms of SLE may be treated with: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for joint symptoms and pleurisy. Talk to your provider before taking these medicines. Low doses of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, for skin and arthritis symptoms. Corticosteroid creams for skin rashes. Hydroxychloroquine, a medicine also used to treat malaria. Methotrexate may be used to reduce the dose of corticosteroids. Belimumab, rituximab, and anifrolumab are biologic medicines that may be helpful in some people. Treatments for more severe SLE may include: High-dose corticosteroids. Immunosuppressive medicines (these medicines suppress the immune system). These medicines are used if you have severe SLE that is affecting your nervous system, kidney, or other organs. They may also be used if you do not get better with corticosteroids, or if your symptoms get worse when you stop taking corticosteroids. Medicines most commonly used include mycophenolate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and valcosporin. Because of its toxicity, cyclophosphamide is limited to a short course of 3 to 6 months. Rituximab is used in some cases as well. Blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin), for clotting disorders such as antiphospholipid syndrome. If you have SLE, it is also important to: Wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and sunscreen when in the sun. Get preventive heart care. Stay up-to-date with immunizations. Have tests to screen for thinning of the bones ( osteoporosis ). Avoid tobacco and drink minimal amounts of alcohol.",

The most common cause of cancer-related death is lung cancer. In the United States, skin cancer followed by breast cancer are the most commonly diagnosed cancers. In US men, other than skin cancer, the three most common cancers are: Prostate cancer Lung cancer Colorectal cancer In US women, other than skin cancer, the three most common cancers are: Breast cancer Lung cancer Colorectal cancer Some cancers are more common in certain parts of the world. For example, in Japan, there are many cases of stomach cancer . But in the United States this type of cancer is much less common. Differences in diet or environmental factors may play a role.

Depending on the location of the tumor, the biopsy may be a simple procedure or a serious operation. Most people with cancer have CT scans to determine the exact location and size of the tumor or tumors. A cancer diagnosis is often difficult to cope with. It is important that you discuss the type, size, and location of the cancer with your health care provider when you are diagnosed. You also will want to ask about treatment options, along with the prognosis (likely outcome), benefits, and risks. Its a good idea to have someone with you at the providers office to help you get through and understand the diagnosis. If you have trouble asking questions after hearing about your diagnosis, the person you bring with you can ask them for you.",

    "text": "Treatment The treatment varies, based on the type of cancer and its stage. The stage of a cancer refers to how much it has grown and whether the cancer has spread from its original location. If the cancer is in one location and has not spread, the most common treatment approach is surgery to cure it. This is often the case with skin cancers, as well as cancers of the lung, breast, and colon. If the cancer has spread to local lymph nodes only, sometimes these can also be removed with the cancer. If surgery cannot remove all of the cancer, the options for treatment may include radiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , targeted cancer therapies , or other types of treatment. Some cancers require a combination of treatments. Lymphoma, or cancer of the lymph glands, is rarely treated with surgery. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, and other nonsurgical therapies are often used. Although treatment for cancer can be difficult, there are many ways to keep up your strength. If you have radiation treatment: Treatment is usually scheduled every weekday. You should allow 30 minutes for each treatment session, although the treatment itself usually takes only a few minutes. You should get plenty of rest and eat a well-balanced diet during the course of your radiation therapy. Skin in the treated area may become sensitive and easily irritated. Some side effects of radiation treatment are temporary. They vary, depending on the area of the body that is being treated. If you have chemotherapy: Eat well. Get plenty of rest, and dont feel like you have to accomplish tasks all at once. Avoid people with colds, the flu, COVID-19 , or any other infectious illness. Chemotherapy can cause your immune system to weaken. Talk with family, friends, or a support group about your feelings. Work with your providers throughout your treatment. Helping yourself can make you feel more in control.",

This problem often becomes noticeable in your early to mid-40s and is very common. Cataracts -- Cloudiness of the eye lens, causing poor nighttime vision, halos around lights, and sensitivity to glare. Cataracts are common in older people. Glaucoma -- Increased pressure in the eye, which is most often painless. Vision will be normal at first, but over time you can develop poor night vision, blind spots, and a loss of vision to either side. Some types of glaucoma can also happen suddenly, which is a medical emergency. Diabetic eye disease . Macular degeneration -- Loss of central vision, blurred vision (particularly while reading), distorted vision (straight lines will appear to be wavy), and colors that look faded. This is the most common cause of blindness in people over age 60 years. Eye infection, inflammation, or injury. Floaters -- Tiny particles drifting inside the eye, which may be a sign of retinal detachment. Night blindness . Retinal detachment -- Symptoms include floaters, sparks, or flashes of light in your vision, or a sensation of a shade or curtain hanging across part of your visual field. Optic neuritis -- Inflammation of the optic nerve from infection or multiple sclerosis . You may have pain when you move your eye or touch it through the eyelid. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Brain tumor . Bleeding into the eye. Temporal arteritis -- Inflammation of an artery in the brain that supplies blood to the optic nerve. Migraine headaches -- Spots of light, halos, or zigzag patterns that appear before the start of the headache. Medicines may also affect your vision.",

Gradual loss of the sharpness of your vision. Difficulty telling colors apart. Blurred vision when trying to view objects near or far. Diabetes or a family history of diabetes. Eye itching or discharge. Vision changes that seem related to medicine. (Do not stop or change a medicine without talking to your provider.)",

    "text": "What to Expect at Your Office Visit Your provider will check your vision, eye movements, pupils, the back of your eye (called the retina), and eye pressure. An overall medical evaluation will be done if needed. It will be helpful to your provider if you can describe your symptoms accurately. Think about the following ahead of time: Has the problem affected your vision Is there blurring, halos around lights, flashing lights, or blind spots Do colors seem faded Do you have pain Are you sensitive to light Do you have tearing or discharge Do you have dizziness, or does it seem like the room is spinning Do you have double vision Is the problem in one or both eyes When did this begin Did it occur suddenly or gradually Is it constant or does it come and go How often does it occur How long does it last When does it occur Evening Morning Is there anything that makes it better Worse The provider will also ask you about any eye problems you have had in the past: Has this ever happened before Have you been given eye medicines Have you had eye surgery or injuries Have you recently traveled out of the country Are there new things you could be allergic to, such as soaps, sprays, lotions, creams, cosmetics, laundry products, curtains, sheets, carpets, paint, or pets The provider will also ask about your general health and family history: Do you have any known allergies When did you last have a general checkup Are you taking any medicines Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure What kinds of eye problems do your family members have The following tests may be performed: Dilated eye exam Slit-lamp examination Refraction (test for glasses) Tonometry (eye pressure test) Treatments depend on the cause. Surgery may be needed for some conditions.",

COVID-19 self-tests are available over-the-counter at most pharmacies. If needed, your health care provider can test you for the flu, COVID-19, and other respiratory infections. The flu spreads easily. It can affect a large group of people in a very short amount of time. For example, students and co-workers often get sick within 2 or 3 weeks of the flus arrival in a school or workplace. Sometimes, you can get a virus that makes you throw up or have diarrhea. Some people call this the  stomach flu . This is a misleading name because this virus is usually not the actual flu. The flu mostly affects your nose, throat, and lungs. While certain people are at a higher risk, anyone at any age can develop serious complications from the flu. Those at highest risk include: People age 65 and older Children younger than 5 years old Women who are more than 3 months pregnant Anyone living in a long-term care facility Anyone with chronic heart, lung, or kidney conditions, diabetes, or a weakened immune system People with severe obesity (BMI of 40 or higher)",

Other common symptoms include: Body aches Chills Headache Lack of energy Cough Runny or stuffy nose Sneezing Sore throat Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children) Fever usually goes away in 3 to 4 days but may last up to 8 days. Other symptoms get better in 7 to 14 days. The cough and tired feeling may last for weeks. Sometimes, the fever comes back. Some people may not feel like eating.

    "text": "Treatment HOME CARE Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever and relieve aches. Providers sometimes suggest that you use both types of medicine. Aspirin can also reduce fever and aches, but it may have potential serious side effects, such as stomach bleeding. So its best to avoid using aspirin and it should never be given to treat flu in someone age 18 or less. A fever does not need to come all the way down to a normal temperature to make a difference in how a person feels. Most people feel at least somewhat better when their temperature drops by 1 degree Fahrenheit. Here are other ways to relieve symptoms: Over-the-counter cold medicines may make some of your symptoms better. Cough drops or throat sprays will help with your sore throat. Get plenty of rest. Drink plenty of liquids. Do not smoke or drink alcohol. Certain medicines should not be given to children, or only after a certain age. Do not give cold medicines to children younger than 4 years old. Only give cold medicines to children ages 4 to 6 years if your provider recommends it. Do not give ibuprofen to children younger than 6 months unless directed by your provider. Aspirin should not be used in children and teens due to the risk of Reye syndrome . ANTIVIRAL DRUGS Most people with milder symptoms do not need to see a provider or take antiviral medicines. Your provider may recommend antiviral treatment if you are very sick with the flu. You also may be given antivirals if you are at risk for serious illness. Children at risk for a severe case of the flu may also need these medicines. The health problems below may increase the risk of getting sicker with the flu: Being younger than age 5 years (those under age 2 are even more at risk) or age 65 or older Lung disease (including asthma ) Heart conditions (except high blood pressure) Kidney, liver, nerve, and muscle conditions Blood disorders (including sickle cell disease) Diabetes A weakened immune system due to diseases (such as AIDS), radiation therapy, or certain medicines, including chemotherapy and corticosteroids Neurological diseases such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and muscular dystrophy Other long-term medical problems These medicines may shorten the time you have symptoms by about 1 day.

There are two types: Influenza (flu) vaccine (live, intranasal) : This vaccine is a nasal spray. People ages 2 through 49 years who are not pregnant may receive LAIV. Influenza (flu) vaccine (inactivated or recombinant) : This vaccine is delivered by injection. Everyone 6 months and older can get the vaccine. To help prevent spreading the flu when you are sick, stay home and away from others both inside and outside your household As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from others in your home. Use a separate bathroom if you can. Keep track of your symptoms. You may receive instructions from your provider on how to check and report your symptoms. Wear a well-fitted face mask or respirator that fits well over your nose and mouth without gaps when you see your provider and anytime other people are in the same room with you. If you cant wear a mask, for example, due to breathing problems, people in your home should wear a mask if they need to be in the same room with you. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing. Throw away the tissue after use. Wash your hands many times a day with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds. Do this before eating or preparing food, after using the toilet, and after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (at least 60 alcohol) if soap and water are not available. Do not share personal items such as cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding. Wash anything you have used in soap and water. Clean all high-touch areas in the home, such as doorknobs, bathroom and kitchen fixtures, toilets, phones, tablets, counters, and other surfaces. Use a household cleaning spray and follow instructions for use. Take steps for cleaner air in your home. You can do this by opening windows, turning on exhaust fans in your bathrooms and kitchen, using portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaners, and setting the fan on your furnace or air conditioning to on if you have central heating and cooling in your home. You can go back to your normal activities if both",

Sometimes many joints become swollen and painful. The pain starts suddenly, often during the night. Pain is often severe, described as throbbing, crushing, or excruciating. The joint appears warm and red. It is most often very tender and swollen (it hurts to put a sheet or blanket over it). There may be a fever . The attack may go away in a few days, but may return from time to time. Additional attacks often last longer. The pain and swelling most often go away after the first attack. Many people will have another attack in the next 6 to 12 months. Some people may develop chronic gout. This is also called gouty arthritis. This condition can lead to joint damage and loss of motion in the joints. People with chronic gout will have joint pain and other symptoms most of the time. Deposits of uric acid can form lumps below the skin around joints or other places such as the elbows, fingertips, and ears. The lump is called a tophus, from Latin, meaning a type of stone. Tophi (multiple lumps) can develop after a person has had gout for many years. These lumps may drain chalky material.",

    "text": "Treatment Take medicines for gout as soon as you can if you have a new attack. Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or indomethacin when symptoms begin. Talk to your health care provider about the correct dose. You may need stronger doses for a few days. A prescription medicine called colchicine helps reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation. Corticosteroids (such as prednisone) can also be very effective. Corticosteroids can be injected into the joint or taken as a pill. Your provider may inject the inflamed joint with steroids to relieve the pain. With attacks of gout in multiple joints an injectable medicine called anakinra (Kineret) may be used. The pain often goes away within 12 hours of starting treatment. Most of the time, all pain is gone within 48 hours. You may need to take daily medicines such as allopurinol (Zyloprim), febuxostat (Uloric) or probenecid (Benemid) to decrease the uric acid level in your blood. Additionally, an intravenous medicine called pegloticase (Kystexxa) is available for severe cases. Lowering the uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL is needed to prevent deposits of uric acid. If you have visible tophi, the uric acid should be lower than 5 mg/dL. You may need these medicines if: You have several attacks during the same year or your attacks are quite severe. You have damage to joints. You have tophi. You have kidney disease or kidney stones . Diet and lifestyle changes may help prevent gouty attacks: Decrease alcohol, especially beer (some wine may be helpful). Lose weight. Exercise daily. Limit your intake of red meat and sugary beverages. Choose healthy foods, such as dairy products, vegetables, nuts, legumes, fruits (less sugary ones), and whole grains. Coffee and vitamin C supplements (may help some people).",

In adults, bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia. Ways you can get pneumonia include: Bacteria and viruses living in your nose, sinuses, or mouth may spread to your lungs. You may breathe some of these germs directly into your lungs. You breathe in (inhale) food, liquids, vomit, or fluids from the mouth into your lungs ( aspiration pneumonia ). Pneumonia can be caused by many types of germs. The most common type of bacteria is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Atypical pneumonia , often called walking pneumonia, is caused by other bacteria. A fungus called Pneumocystis jirovecii can cause pneumonia in people whose immune system is not working well, especially people with advanced HIV infection. Viruses , such as the flu (influenza) virus, and most recently SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19 ), are also common causes of pneumonia. Risk factors that increase your chance of getting pneumonia include: Chronic lung disease ( COPD , bronchiectasis , cystic fibrosis ) Cigarette smoking Dementia , stroke , brain injury, cerebral palsy , or other brain disorders Immune system problem (during cancer treatment, or due to HIV/AIDS, organ transplant, or other diseases) Other serious illnesses, such as heart disease , liver cirrhosis , or diabetes Recent surgery or trauma Surgery to treat cancer of the mouth, throat, or neck",

Other tests that may be ordered include: Arterial blood gases to see if enough oxygen is getting into your blood from the lungs. Blood and sputum cultures to look for the germ that may be causing the pneumonia. CBC to check white blood cell count . CT scan of the chest . Bronchoscopy in which a flexible tube with a lighted camera on the end passed down to your lungs in selected cases.

    "text": "Treatment Your provider must first decide whether you need to be in the hospital. If you are treated in the hospital, you will receive: Fluids and antibiotics (or antivirals) through your veins Oxygen therapy Breathing treatments (possibly) If you are diagnosed with a bacterial form of pneumonia, it is important that you are started on antibiotics very soon after you are admitted. If you have viral pneumonia, you will not receive antibiotics. This is because antibiotics do not kill viruses. You may receive other medicines, such as antivirals, if you have the flu or other type of viral pneumonia. You are more likely to need to be admitted to the hospital if you: Have another serious medical problem Have severe symptoms Are unable to care for yourself at home, or are unable to eat or drink Are 65 years or older Have been taking antibiotics at home and are not getting better Most people can be treated at home. If so, your provider may tell you to take medicines such as antibiotics. Antibiotics are usually prescribed for 3 to 5 days, although sometimes they may be used for 2 weeks or more. When taking antibiotics: Do not miss any doses. Take the medicine until it is gone, even when you start to feel better. Do not take cough medicine or cold medicine unless your provider says it is OK. Coughing helps your body get rid of mucus from your lungs. Breathing warm, moist (wet) air helps loosen the sticky mucus that may make you feel like you are choking. These things may help: Place a warm, wet washcloth loosely over your nose and mouth. Fill a humidifier with warm water and breathe in the warm mist. Take a couple of deep breaths 2 or 3 times every hour. Deep breaths will help open up your lungs. Tap your chest gently a few times a day while lying with your head lower than your chest. This helps bring up mucus from the lungs so that you can cough it out. Drink plenty of liquids, as long as your provider says it is OK. Drink water, juice, or weak tea Drink at least 6 to 10 cups (1.4 to 2.4 liters) a day Do not drink alcohol Get plenty of rest when you go home. If you have trouble sleeping at night, take naps during the day.",

COVID-19 most readily spreads to people within close contact (about 6 feet or 2 meters). When someone with the illness coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes, droplets and very small particles spray into the air. You can catch the illness if you breathe in these droplets or particles or they land on your eyes, nose, or mouth. In some instances, COVID-19 may spread through the air and infect people who are more than 6 feet away. Small droplets and particles can remain in the air for minutes to hours. This is called airborne (or aerosol) transmission, and it occurs especially in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. However, it is more common for COVID-19 to spread through close contact.",

Less often, the illness can spread if you touch a surface with the virus on it, and then touch your eyes, nose, mouth, or face. But this is thought to be a much less common way in which the virus spreads. COVID-19 can spread from person to person quickly. As the virus spreads, it can change, and new variants of the virus will occur. Different variants may spread more quickly or be more resistant to treatments or vaccines. Taking steps to slow the spread of the virus, such as by getting a COVID-19 vaccine, can help slow the development of new variants. While the United States Federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency has ended, COVID-19 is still a health concern, especially for people at high risk of serious illness.",

Symptoms may change with new variants of the virus. Some people may have no symptoms at all. Many people have some, but not all of these symptoms. Symptoms can also vary, depending on whether you are vaccinated and boosted. Symptoms may appear within 2 to 14 days after being exposed. Most often, symptoms appear around 5 days after exposure.

The types of medicines given may vary depending upon how sick you are, your risk factors for serious illness from the disease, your age, and possibly what variant of the virus is causing the infection. If you test positive for COVID-19, your provider may recommend antiviral medicines. If given soon after you become infected (5 to 7 days, depending on the medicine), these medicines help your immune system fight off the virus. They may be given to adults and children with mild to moderate illness who are not hospitalized. These medicines include: Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir (Paxlovid), an antiviral medicine, to help slow the virus. It is a pill you take at home. Remdesivir (Veklury), an antiviral medicine, to help slow the virus. This medicine is given through the vein ( IV ). You will need to go to a health care facility for 3 days in a row to receive this medicine. Molnupiravir (Lagevrio), an antiviral medicine used only for adults. It is a pill you take at home. If you are being cared for in the hospital and are receiving oxygen therapy, treatment for COVID-19 may include the following medicines: Remdesivir, an antiviral medicine, to help slow the virus. Dexamethasone, a steroid medicine, to help reduce an overactive immune response in the body. If dexamethasone is not available, you may be given another corticosteroid such as prednisone, methylprednisolone, or hydrocortisone. You may be given one or the other medicine or both medicines together. Baricitinib or tocilizumab to help reduce immune system activity, depending on your condition. Medicines for any complications from the disease. For example, you may be given blood thinners to help reduce the chance of blood clots, or you may have dialysis if your kidneys do not function properly. Based on available evidence, current treatment guidelines from the National Institutes of Health recommend against using some medicines for COVID-19, including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin. Do not take any medicines to treat COVID-19 except those prescribed by your provider. Check with your provider before treating yourself or a loved one with vitamins, nutrients, or any medicines prescribed in the past for other health problems.

Research indicates that adults should get 7 to 9 hours sleep per night. Treatment often begins by reviewing any medicines or health problems that may be causing or worsen insomnia, such as: Enlarged prostate gland or any other medical condition, causing men to wake up at night to urinate Pain or discomfort from muscle, joint, or nerve disorders, such as arthritis and Parkinson disease Other medical conditions, such as acid reflux, allergies, and thyroid problems Mental health disorders, such as depression and anxiety You should also think about lifestyle and sleep habits that may affect your sleep. This is called sleep hygiene. Making some changes in your sleep habits may improve or solve your insomnia. Some people may need medicines to help with sleep for a short period of time. But in the long run, making changes in your lifestyle and sleep habits is the best treatment for problems with falling and staying asleep. Most over-the-counter (OTC) sleeping pills contain antihistamines. These medicines are commonly used to treat allergies. Your body quickly becomes used to them. Sleep medicines called hypnotics can be prescribed by your provider to help reduce the time it takes you to fall asleep. Most of these can become habit-forming. Medicines used to treat anxiety or depression can also help with sleep Different methods of talk therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), may help you gain control over anxiety or depression.",

    "text": "Considerations Normal body temperature may change during any given day. It is usually highest in the evening. Other factors that may affect body temperature are: A womans menstrual cycle. In the second part of this cycle, her temperature may go up by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more. Physical activity, strong emotion, eating, heavy clothing, medicines, high room temperature, and high humidity can all increase body temperature. Fever is an important part of the bodys defense against infection. Most bacteria and viruses that cause infections in people thrive best at 98.6F (37C). Many infants and children develop high fevers with mild viral illnesses. Although a fever signals that a battle might be going on in the body, the fever is fighting for, not against the person. Brain damage from a fever generally will not occur unless the fever is over 107.6F (42C). Untreated fevers caused by infection will seldom go over 105F (40.6C) unless the child is overdressed or in a hot place. Febrile seizures do occur in some children. Most febrile seizures are over quickly and do not mean your child has epilepsy. These seizures also do not cause any permanent harm. Unexplained fevers that continue for days or weeks are called fevers of undetermined origin (FUO).",

Teething may cause a slight increase in a childs temperature, but not higher than 100F (37.8C). Autoimmune or inflammatory disorders may also cause fevers. Some examples are: Arthritis or connective tissue illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease Vasculitis or periarteritis nodosa The first symptom of a cancer may be a fever. This is particularly true of Hodgkin disease , non-Hodgkin lymphoma , and leukemia . Other possible causes of fever include: Blood clots or thrombophlebitis Medicines, such as some antibiotics, antihistamines, and seizure medicines",

    "text": "Home Care A simple cold or other viral infection can sometimes cause a high fever (102F to 104F or 38.9C to 40C). This does not mean you or your child has a serious problem. Some serious infections dont cause a fever or can cause a very low body temperature, most often in infants. If the fever is mild and you have no other problems, you do not need treatment. Drink fluids and rest. The illness is probably not serious if your child: Is still interested in playing Is eating and drinking well Is alert and smiling at you Has a normal skin color Looks well when their temperature comes down Take steps to lower a fever if you or your child is uncomfortable, vomiting, dried out (dehydrated), or not sleeping well. Remember, the goal is to lower, not eliminate, the fever. When trying to lower a fever: Do not bundle up someone who has chills. Remove excess clothing or blankets. The room should be comfortable, not too hot or cool. Try one layer of lightweight clothing, and one lightweight blanket for sleep. If the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help. A lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool someone with a fever. This is effective after medicine is given -- otherwise the temperature might bounce right back up. Do not use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs. These cool the skin, but often make the situation worse by causing shivering, which raises the core body temperature. Here are some guidelines for taking medicine to lower a fever: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce fever in children and adults. Sometimes health care providers advise you to use both types of medicine. Take acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours. It works by turning down the brains thermostat. Take ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours. Do not use ibuprofen in children 6 months or younger. Aspirin is very effective for treating fever in adults. Do not give aspirin to a child unless your childs provider tells you to. Know how much you or your child weighs. Then check the instructions on the package to find the correct dose. In children 3 months or younger, contact your childs provider first before giving medicines. Eating and drinking: Everyone, particularly children, should drink plenty of fluids. Water, ice pops, soup, and gelatin are all good choices. In younger children do",

The type of seizure depends on the part of the brain that is affected. Most of the time, for people with epilepsy, their seizures are similar to ones before it. Some people with epilepsy have a strange sensation before each seizure. Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, or emotional changes. This is called an aura. Your health care provider can tell you more about the specific type of seizure you may have: Absence seizures (also called non-motor seizures) include seizures involving a change in behavior but without changes in motor movement (such as staring spells). They may occur along with generalized seizures. Focal onset seizures may occur with no change in awareness. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain is affected. These seizures may spread to the whole brain. Generalized seizures involve both sides of the brain and cause impaired awareness. Abnormal movements involving the whole body are often present. Clenching of the jaw and losing control of the urine or bowels may occur.",

In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brains electrical activity may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures. Tests that may be done include: Blood chemistry Blood sugar Complete blood count (CBC) Kidney function tests Genetic tests Liver function tests Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) Tests for infectious diseases Head CT or MRI scan is often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. To diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, you may also need to: Wear an EEG recorder for days or weeks as you go about your everyday life. Stay in a special hospital where brain activity can be recorded while video cameras capture what happens to you during the seizure. This is called a video EEG.",

    "text": "Treatment Treatment for epilepsy includes taking medicines, lifestyle changes, and sometimes surgery. If epilepsy is due to a tumor, abnormal blood vessels, or bleeding in the brain, surgery to treat these disorders may make the seizures stop. Medicines to prevent seizures, called antiseizure medicines (also called anticonvulsants or antiepileptic medicines), may reduce the number of future seizures: These medicines are taken by mouth. Which type you are prescribed depends on the type of seizures you have. Your dosage may need to be changed from time to time. You may need regular blood tests to check for side effects. Always take your medicine on time and as directed. Missing a dose can cause you to have a seizure. Do not stop taking or change medicines on your own. Talk to your provider first. Many epilepsy medicines cause birth defects. Women who plan to become pregnant should tell their provider in advance in order to adjust medicines. Many epilepsy medicines may affect the health of your bones. Talk to your provider about whether you need vitamins and other supplements. Epilepsy that does not get better after 2 or 3 anti-seizure medicines have been tried is called medically refractory epilepsy. In this case, your provider may recommend surgery to: Remove the abnormal brain cells causing the seizures. Place a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). This device is similar to a heart pacemaker. It can help reduce the number of seizures. Some children are placed on a special diet to help prevent seizures. The most popular one is the ketogenic diet. A diet low in carbohydrates, such as the Atkins diet, may also be helpful in some adults. Be sure to discuss these options with your provider before trying them. Lifestyle or medical changes can increase the risk for a seizure in adults and children with epilepsy. Talk with your provider about: New prescribed medicines, vitamins, or supplements Emotional stress Illness, especially infection Lack of sleep Pregnancy Skipping doses of epilepsy medicines Use of alcohol or other recreational drugs Exposure to flickering lights or stimuli Hyperventilation Other considerations: People with epilepsy should wear medical alert jewelry so that prompt treatment can be obtained if a seizure occurs. People with poorly controlled epilepsy should not drive. Check your states law about which people with a history of seizures are allowed to drive.

In some cases, hepatitis may lead to liver damage, liver failure, cirrhosis, liver cancer or even death. There are several factors that can affect how severe the condition is. These may include the cause of the liver damage and any illnesses you have. Hepatitis A, for example, is most often short-term and does not lead to chronic liver problems. The symptoms of hepatitis include: Pain or bloating in the belly area Dark urine and pale or clay-colored stools Fatigue Low grade fever Itching Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes) Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Weight loss You may not have symptoms when first infected with hepatitis B or C. You can still develop liver failure later. If you have any risk factors for either type of hepatitis, ask your health care provider whether you should be tested for them.",

This type is much less common than late onset. It tends to get worse quickly. Early onset disease can run in families. Several genes have been identified. Late onset Alzheimer disease -- This is the most common type. It occurs in people age 60 and older. It may run in some families, but the role of genes is less clear.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition in which a person has more memory and thinking problems than other people their age. People with MCI have mild problems with thinking and memory that do not interfere with daily activities. They are often aware of the forgetfulness. Not everyone with MCI develops Alzheimer disease. Symptoms of MCI include: Difficulty doing more than one task at a time Difficulty solving problems or making decisions Forgetting names of familiar people, recent events, or conversations Taking longer to do more difficult mental activities Early symptoms of Alzheimer disease can include: Difficulty performing tasks that take some thought, but used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing complex games (bridge), and learning new information or routines Getting lost on familiar routes Language problems, such as trouble remembering the names of familiar objects Losing interest in things previously enjoyed and being in a flat mood Misplacing items Personality changes and loss of social skills Mood changes leading to aggressive behavior Poor performance of job duties As Alzheimer disease becomes worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of oneself. Symptoms may include: Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night Delusions, depression , and agitation Difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, and driving Difficulty reading or writing Forgetting details about current events Forgetting events in ones life history and losing self-awareness Hallucinations , arguments, striking out, and violent behavior Poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger Using the wrong word, mispronouncing words, or speaking in confusing sentences Withdrawing from social contact People with severe Alzheimer disease can no longer: Recognize family members Perform basic activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, and bathing Understand language Other symptoms that may occur with Alzheimer disease: Problems controlling bowel movements or urine Swallowing problems",

A skilled health care provider can often diagnose Alzheimer disease with the following steps: Performing a complete physical exam, including a nervous system exam. Asking about the persons medical history and symptoms. Mental function tests (mental status examination). Neuropsychological testing. PET scan and lumbar puncture (spinal tap) are sometimes needed to confirm Alzheimer disease. Tests may be done to rule out other possible causes of dementia, including: Anemia Brain tumor Long-term (chronic) infection Intoxication from medicines Severe depression Increased fluid on the brain (normal pressure hydrocephalus) Stroke Thyroid disease Vitamin deficiency CT or MRI of the brain may be done to look for other causes of dementia, such as a brain tumor or stroke.

BMI is used to estimate your level of body fat based on your weight and height measured in kilograms and meters. A BMI from 18.5 to 24.9 falls within a healthy weight range. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 falls within the overweight range. Since BMI only estimates how your weight compares to what is healthy, it is not accurate for all people. Some people in this group, such as athletes, may have a lot of muscle weight, and therefore not as much fat. These people will not have an increased risk of health problems due to their weight. A BMI of 30 or higher falls within the obesity range. There are three classes of obesity: Class 1: BMI of 30 to less than 35. Class 2: BMI of 35 to less than 40. Class 3: BMI of 40 or higher. Class 3 is considered severe obesity. The risk for many medical problems is higher for adults who have excess body fat and fall into the overweight groups. CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE An active lifestyle and plenty of exercise, along with healthy eating , is the safest way to lose weight. Even modest weight loss can improve your health. Get support from family and friends. Your main goal should be to learn new, healthy ways of eating and make them part of your daily routine. Many people find it hard to change their eating habits and behaviors. You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle. Work with your health care provider and dietitian to set realistic and safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight. Keep in mind that if you drop your weight slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep it off. Your dietitian can teach you about: Shopping for healthy foods How to read nutrition labels Healthy snacks Portion sizes Sweetened drinks",

Jaw tremor has also been an early sign of Parkinson disease. Symptoms may affect one or both sides of the body. General symptoms may include: Problems with balance and walking Rigid or stiff muscles Muscle aches and pains Low blood pressure when you stand up ( orthostatic hypotension ) Stooped posture Constipation Sweating and not being able to control your body temperature Slow or infrequent blinking Difficulty swallowing Drooling Slowed, quieter speech and monotone voice No expression in your face (like you are wearing a mask) Unable to write clearly or handwriting is very small (micrographia) Movement problems may include: Difficulty starting movement, such as starting to walk or getting out of a chair Difficulty continuing to move Slowed movements Loss of fine hand movements (writing may become small and difficult to read) Difficulty eating Symptoms of shaking (tremors): Usually occur when your limbs are not moving. This is called resting tremor. May occur when your arm or leg is held out. Go away when you move. May be worse when you are tired, excited, or stressed. Can cause you to rub your finger and thumb together without meaning to (called pill-rolling tremor). Eventually may occur in your head, lips, tongue, and feet. Other symptoms may include: Anxiety, stress, and tension Cognitive changes Confusion Depression Disturbed sleep Fainting Low blood pressure Memory loss",

The examination may show: Difficulty starting or finishing a movement Jerky, stiff movements Muscle loss Shaking (tremors) Changes in your heart rate Abnormal muscle reflexes Your provider may do some tests to check for other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.

    "text": "Treatment There is no cure for Parkinson disease, but treatment can help control your symptoms. MEDICINE Your provider may prescribe medicines to help control your shaking and movement symptoms. At certain times during the day, the medicine may wear off and symptoms can return. If this happens, your provider may need to change any of the following: Type of medicine Dose Amount of time between doses The way you take the medicine You may also need to take medicines to help with: Mood and thinking problems Pain relief Sleep problems Drooling (botulinum toxin is often used) Parkinson medicines can cause side effects that may be severe, including: Confusion Seeing or hearing things that are not there ( hallucinations ) Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea Feeling lightheaded or fainting Behaviors that are hard to control, such as gambling Delirium Tell your provider right away if you have these side effects. Never change or stop taking any medicines without talking with your provider. Stopping some medicines for Parkinson disease may lead to a severe reaction. Work with your provider to find a treatment plan that works for you. As the disease gets worse, symptoms such as stooped posture, frozen movements, and speech problems may not respond to the medicines. SURGERY Surgery may be an option for some people. Surgery does not cure Parkinson disease, but it may help ease symptoms. Types of surgery include: Deep brain stimulation -- This involves placing electric stimulators in areas of the brain that control movement. Surgery to destroy certain brain tissues in order to reduce Parkinson symptoms. Stem cell transplant and other procedures are being studied. LIFESTYLE Certain lifestyle changes may help you cope with Parkinson disease: Stay healthy by eating nutritious foods and not smoking . Make changes in what you eat or drink if you have swallowing problems . Use speech therapy to help you adjust to changes in your swallowing and speech. Stay active as much as possible when you feel good. Do not overdo it when your energy is low. Rest as needed during the day and avoid stress. Use physical therapy and occupational therapy to help you stay independent and reduce the risk of falls. Place handrails throughout your house to help prevent falls . Place them in bathrooms and along stairways. Use assistive devices, when needed, to make movement easier. These devices may include special eating utensils, wheelchairs, bed lifts, shower",

    "text": "Treatment Most people DO NOT need antibiotics for acute bronchitis caused by a virus. The infection will almost always go away on its own within 1 week, though a mild cough may persist for up to 3 weeks. Doing these things may help you feel better: Drink plenty of fluids. If you have asthma or another chronic lung condition, use your inhaler . Get plenty of rest. Take aspirin or acetaminophen if you have a fever. DO NOT give aspirin to people under age 18. Breathe moist air by using a humidifier or steaming up the bathroom. Certain medicines that you can buy without a prescription can help break up or loosen mucus. Look for the word guaifenesin on the label. If needed, ask the pharmacist for help finding it. If your symptoms do not improve or if you are wheezing , your provider may prescribe an inhaler to open your airways. If your provider thinks you also have bacteria in your airways, they may prescribe antibiotics. This medicine will only get rid of bacteria, not viruses. Your provider may also prescribe corticosteroid medicine to reduce swelling in your lungs. If you have influenza and it is caught in the first 48 hours after getting sick, your provider might also prescribe antiviral medicine. Other tips include: DO NOT smoke. Avoid secondhand smoke and air pollution. Wash your hands (and your childrens hands) often to avoid spreading viruses and other germs.",

    "text": "Symptoms In some cases, symptoms may be very noticeable. But, you can have the disease and not have any symptoms. This is more often true in the early stages of CHD. Chest pain or discomfort ( angina ) is the most common symptom. You feel this pain when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The pain may feel different from person to person. It may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may feel it under your breast bone (sternum). You may also feel it in your neck, arms, stomach, or upper back. The pain most often occurs with activity or emotion. It goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin. Other symptoms can include shortness of breath and fatigue with activity (exertion), or even feeling lightheaded or passing out with exertion. Some people have symptoms other than chest pain, such as: Fatigue Shortness of breath General weakness",

    "text": "Treatment You may be asked to take one or more medicines to treat blood pressure, diabetes , or high cholesterol levels . Follow your providers directions closely to help prevent CHD from getting worse. Goals for treating these conditions in people who have CHD: The most commonly used blood pressure target for people with heart disease is less than 130/80, but your provider may recommend a different blood pressure target. If you have diabetes, your HbA1c (glycohemoglobin A1c) blood levels will be monitored and brought down to the level your provider recommends. Your LDL cholesterol level will be lowered with statin or other medicines. Treatment depends on your symptoms and how severe the disease is. You should know about: Other medicines used to treat angina . What to do when you have chest pain . Being active when you have heart disease. Eating a heart-healthy diet . Never stop taking your medicines without first talking to your provider. Stopping heart medicines suddenly can make your angina worse or cause a heart attack. You may be referred to a cardiac rehabilitation program to help improve your hearts fitness. Procedures and surgeries used to treat CHD include: Angioplasty and stent placement , called percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) Coronary artery bypass surgery Minimally invasive heart surgery",

The pain most often occurs on one side of the body. Some people have sharp pain in one part of the leg or hip and numbness in other parts. The pain or numbness may also be felt on the back of the calf or on the sole of the foot. The affected leg may feel weak. Sometimes, your foot gets caught on the ground when walking. The pain may start slowly. It may get worse: After standing or sitting During certain times of the day, such as at night When sneezing, coughing, or laughing, especially if caused by a herniated disk When bending backward or walking more than a few yards or meters, especially if caused by spinal stenosis When straining or holding your breath, such as during a bowel movement",

    "text": "Treatment As sciatica is a symptom of a more specific medical condition, the underlying cause should be identified and treated. In most cases, no surgical treatment is required and recovery occurs with conservative treatment. Conservative (non-surgical) treatment is best in many cases. Your provider may recommend the following steps to reduce your symptoms: Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Apply heat or ice to the painful area. Try ice for the first 48 to 72 hours, then use heat. Measures to take care of your back at home may include: Bed rest is not recommended. Back exercises are recommended early on to strengthen your back. Start exercising again after 2 to 3 weeks. Include exercises to strengthen your abdominal (core) muscles and improve the flexibility of your spine. Reduce your activity for the first couple of days. Then, slowly start your usual activities. Do not do heavy lifting or twisting of your back for the first 6 weeks after the pain begins. Your provider may also suggest physical therapy to help you learn an exercise program. Additional treatments depend on the condition that is causing the sciatica. If these measures do not help, your provider may recommend injections of certain medicines to reduce swelling around the nerve. Other medicines may be prescribed to help reduce the stabbing pains due to nerve irritation. Nerve pain may be very difficult to treat. If you have ongoing problems with pain, you may want to see a physiatrist (specialist in rehabilitation) or a pain specialist to ensure that you have access to the widest range of treatment options. Surgery can be performed to relieve the compression of your spinal nerves, however, it is usually the last resort for treatment.",

    "text": "Treatment The goal of treatment is to cure the infection with medicines that fight TB bacteria. Active pulmonary TB is treated with a combination of many medicines (usually 4 medicines). The person takes the medicines until lab tests show which medicines work best. You may need to take many different pills at different times of the day for 6 months or longer. It is very important that you take the pills the way your provider instructed. When people do not take their TB medicines like they are supposed to, the infection can become much more difficult to treat. The TB bacteria can become resistant to treatment. This means the medicines no longer work. If a person is not taking all the medicines as directed, a nurse or public health worker may need to watch the person take the prescribed medicines. This approach is called directly observed therapy. In this case, medicines may be given 2 or 3 times a week. You may need to stay at home or be admitted to a hospital for 2 to 4 weeks to avoid spreading the disease to others until you are no longer contagious. Your provider is required by law to report your TB illness to the local health department. Your health care team will ensure that you receive the best care.",

Skin testing for TB is used in high-risk populations or in people who may have been exposed to TB, such as health care workers. People who have been exposed to TB should have a skin test as soon as possible and have a follow-up test at a later date, if the first test is negative. A positive skin test means you have come into contact with the TB bacteria. It does not mean that you have active TB or are contagious. Talk to your provider about how to prevent developing active TB. Prompt treatment is very important in preventing the spread of TB from those who have active TB to those who have never been infected with TB. Some countries with a high incidence of TB give people a vaccine called BCG to prevent TB. But, the effectiveness of this vaccine is limited and it is not used in the United States for the prevention of TB. People who have had BCG may still be skin-tested for TB. Discuss the test results (if positive) with your provider.",

To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed: A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body. An organ in the upper abdomen, below and behind the stomach, called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel. People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because: Their pancreas does not make enough insulin Their cells do not respond to insulin normally (also called insulin resistance) Both of the above There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type: Type 1 diabetes is less common, accounting for 5 to 10 of people with diabetes in the United States. It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin are damaged by an immune process and stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause of the immune process is unknown. Type 2 diabetes is more common, accounting for 90 to 95 of people with diabetes in the United States. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesnt use insulin as well as it should. Not all people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese. There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Examples include LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, a variant of type 1",

Your health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 11.1 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or higher. To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done. Blood tests: Fasting blood glucose level . Diabetes is diagnosed if the fasting glucose level is 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) or higher on two different tests, when the person is in their usual state of health. Levels from 100 mg/dL to 125 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L to 7.0 mmol/L) are called impaired fasting glucose or prediabetes. These levels are risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes. Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) test. Normal is less than 5.7 prediabetes is 5.7 to 6.4 and diabetes is 6.5 or higher. Oral glucose tolerance test . Diabetes is diagnosed if the glucose level is 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher 2 hours after drinking a special 75 gram sugar drink. This test is used most often for type 2 diabetes and is rarely needed for type 1 diabetes. Screening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for: Adults who are overweight or obese (BMI of 25 kilograms per square meter or higher in most adults or BMI of 23 or higher in Asian Americans) starting at age 35 repeated every 3 years Women who are overweight and have other risk factors such as high blood pressure who are planning to become pregnant All adults age 35 or older, repeated every 3 years or at a younger age if the person has risk indicators such as high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, established cardiovascular disease, history of gestational diabetes/polycystic ovary syndrome/HIV, prediabetes, exposure to medicines known to cause diabetes, or having a mother, father, sister, or brother with diabetes. In 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there was not enough evidence to recommend screening for type 2 diabetes in all people 18 years old or younger. Some experts do advocate such screening for overweight children. Ask your childs provider what is best for them.",

Some cases of type 2 diabetes can also be improved with weight loss surgery. There is no cure for type 1 diabetes (except for a pancreas or islet cell transplant). Treating either type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes involves nutrition, activity and medicines to control blood sugar level. Everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes. Ask your provider about seeing a certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES). Getting better control over your blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure levels helps reduce the risk for kidney disease, eye disease, nervous system disease, heart attack, and stroke. To minimize diabetes complications, visit your provider at least 2 to 4 times a year. Talk about any problems you are having. Follow your providers instructions on managing your diabetes.",

Your provider will try to determine the cause of your back pain and whether it is likely to quickly get better with simple measures such as ice, mild painkillers, physical therapy, and proper exercises. Most of the time, back pain will get better using these methods. During the physical exam, your provider will try to pinpoint the location of the pain and figure out how it affects your movement. Most people with back pain improve or recover within 4 to 6 weeks and often much sooner than that. Your provider may not order any tests of your spine during the first visit or for 4 to 6 weeks unless you have certain symptoms. Tests that might be ordered include: Blood tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) X-ray CT scan of the lower spine MRI of the lower spine",

    "text": "Treatment To get better quickly, take the right measures when you first feel pain. Here are some tips for how to handle pain: Stop or reduce normal physical activity for the first few days. This will help relieve your symptoms and reduce any swelling in the area of the pain. Apply heat or ice to the painful area. One good method is to use ice for the first 48 to 72 hours and then use heat. Take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Follow package instructions on how much to take. Do not take more than the recommended amount. While sleeping, try lying in a curled-up, fetal position with a pillow between your legs. If you usually sleep on your back, place a pillow or rolled towel under your knees to relieve pressure. A common misbelief about back pain is that you need to rest and avoid activity for a long time. In fact, bed rest is not recommended. If you have no sign of a serious cause for your back pain (such as loss of bowel or bladder control, weakness, weight loss, or fever), then you should stay as active as possible. It is important to prevent your back and abdominal muscles from becoming too weak. You should reduce your activity only for the first couple of days. Then, slowly start your usual activities after that. Do not perform activities that involve heavy lifting or twisting of your back for the first 6 weeks after the pain begins. After 2 to 3 weeks, you should gradually start exercising again. Begin with light aerobic activity. Walking, riding a stationary bicycle, and swimming are great examples. These activities can improve blood flow to your back and promote healing. They also strengthen muscles in your stomach and back. You may benefit from physical therapy. Your provider will determine whether you need to see a physical therapist and can refer you to one. The physical therapist will first use methods to reduce your pain. Then, the therapist will teach you ways to prevent getting back pain again. Stretching and strengthening exercises are important. But, starting these exercises too soon after an injury can make your pain worse. A physical therapist can tell you when to begin stretching and strengthening exercises and how to do them. If your pain lasts longer than 1 month, your primary provider may send",

    "text": "Prevention There are many things you can do to lower your chances of getting back pain. Exercise is important for preventing back pain. Through exercise you can: Improve your posture Strengthen your back and improve flexibility Lose weight Avoid falls It is also very important to learn to lift and bend properly. Follow these tips: If an object is too heavy or awkward, get help. Spread your feet apart to give your body a wide base of support when lifting. Stand as close as possible to the object you are lifting. Bend at your knees, not at your waist. Tighten your stomach muscles as you lift the object or lower it down. Hold the object as close to your body as you can. Lift using your leg muscles. As you stand up with the object, do not bend forward. Do not twist while you are bending down for the object, lifting it up, or carrying it. Other measures to prevent back pain include: Avoid standing for long periods. If you must stand for your work, alternate resting each foot on a stool. Do not wear high heels. Use cushioned soles when walking. When sitting for work, especially if you are using a computer, make sure your chair has a straight back with an adjustable seat and back, armrests, and a swivel seat. Use a stool under your feet while sitting so that your knees are higher than your hips. Place a small pillow or rolled towel behind your lower back while sitting or driving for long periods. If you drive a long distance, stop and walk around every hour. Bring your seat as far forward as possible to avoid bending. Do not lift heavy objects just after a ride. Quit smoking. Lose weight. Do exercises on a regular basis to strengthen your abdominal and core muscles. This will strengthen your core to decrease the risk for further injuries. Learn to relax. Try methods such as yoga, tai chi, or massage.",

As OA worsens, bony spurs or extra bone may form around the joint. The ligaments and muscles around the joint may become weaker and stiffer. Before age 55, OA occurs equally in men and women. After age 55, it is more common in women. Other factors can also lead to OA. OA tends to run in families. Being overweight increases the risk for OA in the hip, knee, ankle, and foot joints. This is because extra weight causes more wear and tear. Fractures or other joint injuries can lead to OA later in life. This includes injuries to the cartilage and ligaments in your joints. Jobs that involve kneeling or squatting for more than an hour a day, or involve lifting, climbing stairs, or walking increase the risk for OA. Playing sports that involve direct impact on the joint (football), twisting (basketball or soccer), or throwing also increase the risk for OA. Medical conditions that can lead to OA or symptoms similar to OA include: Bleeding disorders that cause bleeding in the joint, such as hemophilia Disorders that block the blood supply near a joint and lead to bone death ( avascular necrosis ) Other types of arthritis, such as long-term (chronic) gout , pseudogout , or rheumatoid arthritis Watch this video about: Osteoarthritis",

The pain is often worse: After exercise When you put weight or pressure on the joint When you use the joint With OA, your joints may become stiffer and harder to move over time. You may notice a rubbing, grating, or crackling sound when you move the joint. Morning stiffness refers to the pain and stiffness you feel when you first wake up in the morning. Stiffness due to OA often lasts for 30 minutes or less. It can last more than 30 minutes if there is inflammation in the joint. It often improves after activity, allowing the joint to warm up. During the day, the pain may get worse when you are active and feel better when you are resting. As OA gets worse, you may have pain even when you are resting. And it may wake you up at night. Some people might not have symptoms, even though x-rays show the physical changes of OA.",

    "text": "Treatment OA cannot be cured, but OA symptoms can be controlled. OA will most likely get worse over time though the pace with which this occurs varies from person to person. You can have surgery, but other treatments can improve your pain and make your life much better. Although these treatments cannot make the OA go away, they can often delay surgery or make your symptoms mild enough to not cause significant problems. MEDICINES Over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers , such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) can help with OA symptoms. You can buy these medicines without a prescription. It is recommended that you should not take more than 3 grams (3,000 milligrams) of acetaminophen a day. If you have liver disease, talk with your provider before taking acetaminophen. Over the counter NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Several other NSAIDs are available by prescription. Talk with your provider before taking an NSAID on a regular basis. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) is a prescription medicine that can also help treat long-term ( chronic ) pain related to OA. Injections of steroid medicines into the arthritic joint often provide significant short to medium-term benefits from the pain of OA. Other medicines that may help include: Pills, such as glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate Capsaicin skin cream to relieve pain LIFESTYLE CHANGES Staying active and getting exercise can maintain joint and overall movement. Ask your provider to recommend an exercise routine or refer you to a physical therapist. Water exercises, such as swimming, are often helpful. Other lifestyle tips include: Applying heat or cold to the joint Eating healthy foods Getting enough rest Losing weight if you are overweight Protecting your joints from injury If the pain from OA gets worse, keeping up with activities may become more difficult or painful. Making changes around the home can help take stress off your joints to relieve some of the pain. If your work is causing stress in certain joints, you may need to adjust your work area or change work tasks. PHYSICAL THERAPY Physical therapy can help improve muscle strength and the motion of stiff joints as well as your balance. If therapy does not make you feel better after 6 to 12 weeks, then it likely will not be helpful. Massage therapy may provide short-term pain relief but does not change the underlying OA process.

Massage therapy may provide short-term pain relief but does not change the underlying OA process. Make sure you work with a licensed massage therapist who is experienced in working on sensitive joints. BRACES Splints and braces may help support weakened joints. Some types limit or prevent the joint from moving. Others may shift pressure off one portion of a joint. Use a brace only when your provider or therapist recommends one. Using a brace the wrong way can cause joint damage, stiffness, and pain. ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese treatment. It is thought that when acupuncture needles stimulate certain points on the body, chemicals that block pain are released. Acupuncture may provide significant pain relief for OA. Yoga and Tai chi have also shown significant benefit in treating the pain from OA. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe, pronounced Sammy) is a manmade form of a natural chemical in the body. It may help reduce joint inflammation and pain. SURGERY Severe cases of OA might benefit from surgery to replace or repair damaged joints. Options include: Arthroscopic surgery to trim torn and damaged cartilage Changing the alignment of a bone to relieve stress on the bone or joint (osteotomy) Surgical fusion of bones, often in the spine ( arthrodesis ) Total or partial replacement of the damaged joint with an artificial joint ( knee replacement , hip replacement , shoulder replacement , ankle replacement , and elbow replacement )",

Section 508 is a federal law that requires agencies to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to electronic information and data comparable to those who do not have disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. The Section 508 standards are the technical requirements and criteria that are used to measure conformance within this law. More information on Section 508 and the technical standards can be found atwww.section508.gov. If you would like to report an accessibility problem with the CDC website, please e-mail the CDC Webmaster using the form below. Be sure to specify the web page or file being referenced in reporting the accessibility issue. Please enter your email address. Please enter the website URL In 1998, Congress amended the Rehabilitation Act to require federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. Inaccessible technology interferes with an individuals ability to obtain and use information quickly and easily. Section 508 was enacted to eliminate barriers in information technology, to make available new opportunities for people with disabilities, and to encourage development of technologies that will help achieve these goals. The law applies to all Federal agencies when they develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Under Section 508 (29 USC 794d), agencies must give disabled employees and members of the public access to information that is comparable to the access available to others.

For more information, see: HHS/CDC System of Records Notices As data retention policies vary from system to system, please check that systems policy or their individual SORN for more detailed information. CDC may work through third-party vendors to use geofencing technologies to reach individuals with critical health information at a specific place and time. These technologies can be particularly useful during a public health emergency. Geofencing technologies are location-based services in which an application (app) or other software program uses a mobile devices global positioning system (GPS) to prompt a specific message, push notification or mobile advertisement (e.g., on web browsers or apps) when that device enters or exits a defined geofence or shortly thereafter. Ageofenceis a virtual perimeter around a real-world geographic area, which could include an airport or land border, school, shopping mall, stadium, or other geographic area. To receive a geofenced message from CDC, you must have certain apps downloaded and either have background location sharing enabled on your device or be actively using those apps while passing through a geofenced area. A geofence does not track your location or your phone number it is solely used to detect devices that may enter a specific geographic area at a point in time so they can receive a CDC-sponsored message. Messages may be delivered multiple times within a few days after crossing through a geofenced area, though CDC will limit the number of times an individual would receive a message. Additionally, CDC requires that individuals always have the option to opt-out of messaging, including any ads that are delivered in real-time and shortly thereafter. CDC may get aggregated data from third-party vendors about the number of times a message is shown, the number of people who see the message, and the number of comments, likes, shares, and clicks a message receives. CDC may also receive aggregated data about the basic demographic groups reached by messages, such as the distribution of ages and gender ranges. CDC does not receive any personally identifiable information (PII) about individuals reached through geotargeted health messages. If you choose toprovide us with information, we may use that information to contact you, respond to your message, or provide you the information or services you requested.

As such, we will take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy and safety of any child from whom information is collected as required by theChildrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

The Web page will specify exactly what the information will be used for, who will see it, and how long it will be kept. Personal information about children under 13 years of age may be needed to respond to his/her communication to us. Personal information about your child will be destroyed immediately upon completion of its intended purpose.

All CDC digital media offerings, including the CDC.gov site, are maintained by the U.S. Government and protected by various provisions of Title 18 of the U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are subject to criminal prosecution in Federal court. At CDC, reasonable precautions are taken to protect CDCs digital platforms, including information automatically collected by or voluntarily submitted to CDC.gov or an official CDC page on a third-party site. For example, we restrict access to personally identifiable information to employees, contractors, and vendors who require access to this information in order to perform their official duties, and exercise controls to limit what data they can view based on the specific needs of their position. Access to official CDC accounts on third-party sites is limited to the individuals who administer those accounts, and all official CDC accounts are clearly labeled. Also, commonly used practices and technical controls are utilized to protect the information in our possession or control, along with CDC.gov itself. These practices and controls include, but are not limited to: encrypting the transfer of personal information over the internet via secure sockets protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) etc., using high-strength firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to safeguard personal information, and maintaining strict technical controls and procedures to ensure the integrity of all data on CDC.gov.
